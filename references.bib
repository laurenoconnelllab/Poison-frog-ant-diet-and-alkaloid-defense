	abstract = {Terrestrial amphibians take up water by abducting the hind limbs and pressing a specialized portion of the ventral skin to a moist surface, using a characteristic behavior called the water absorption response. An assay of the water absorption response was used to quantify physiological factors associated with thirst and water uptake. Dramatic changes in the water absorption response resulted from subtle changes in hydration state and from altering the reserve water supply in the urinary bladder. The water absorption response could be induced by intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular injection of angiotensin {II}, demonstrating that components of the renin-angiotensin system on both sides of the blood-brain barrier have a dipsogenic function in amphibians. These experiments also demonstrated that the water absorption response could be inﬂuenced by changes in barometric pressure. Toads avoided the water absorption response on hyperosmotic substrates, and behavioral experiments showed that the amphibian skin served a sensory function similar to that of the lingual epithelium of mammals. The water absorption response assay has enormous potential as a tool for the investigation of physiological processes and sensory capabilities of amphibians.},

	abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects from around the world with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of ameliorating factors such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest.},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}) and minimum ({CTmin}) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species’ vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent {\textasciitilde}65\% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether {CTmax} and {CTmin} exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species’ thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species’ body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While {CTmax} and {CTmin} had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4\% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their {CTmax}, 25\% might be moderately affected and 70\% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3˚C temperature increase.},

	abstract = {Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on biodiversity, including increasing extinction rates. Current approaches to quantifying such impacts focus on measuring exposure to climatic change and largely ignore the biological differences between species that may significantly increase or reduce their vulnerability. To address this, we present a framework for assessing three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, namely sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity; this draws on species’ biological traits and their modeled exposure to projected climatic changes. In the largest such assessment to date, we applied this approach to each of the world’s birds, amphibians and corals (16,857 species). The resulting assessments identify the species with greatest relative vulnerability to climate change and the geographic areas in which they are concentrated, including the Amazon basin for amphibians and birds, and the central Indo-west Pacific (Coral Triangle) for corals. We found that high concentration areas for species with traits conferring highest sensitivity and lowest adaptive capacity differ from those of highly exposed species, and we identify areas where exposure-based assessments alone may over or under-estimate climate change impacts. We found that 608–851 bird (6–9\%), 670–933 amphibian (11–15\%), and 47–73 coral species (6–9\%) are both highly climate change vulnerable and already threatened with extinction on the {IUCN} Red List. The remaining highly climate change vulnerable species represent new priorities for conservation. Fewer species are highly climate change vulnerable under lower {IPCC} {SRES} emissions scenarios, indicating that reducing greenhouse emissions will reduce climate change driven extinctions. Our study answers the growing call for a more biologically and ecologically inclusive approach to assessing climate change vulnerability. By facilitating independent assessment of the three dimensions of climate change vulnerability, our approach can be used to devise species and areaspecific conservation interventions and indices. The priorities we identify will strengthen global strategies to mitigate climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}) and minimum ({CTmin}) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species’ vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent {\textasciitilde}65\% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether {CTmax} and {CTmin} exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species’ thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species’ body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While {CTmax} and {CTmin} had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4\% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their {CTmax}, 25\% might be moderately affected and 70\% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3˚C temperature increase.},

Eighteen castrated males and 8 intact females were implanted 5 mg androgen pellets for 3 weeks prior to the neuropeptide injection. Among castrated males, 6/9 testosterone (T) implanted, 4/9 dihydrotestosterone ({DHT}) implanted and 2/6 non implanted individuals produced calls after being administered {AVT}. 5/6 intact non implanted males and 6/8 T intact implanted females also called, and 3 intact non implanted females remained silent after the injection. Evoked calls had a mid-frequency spectral peak at about 1900 Hz which is absent in field-recorded mating calls of this species. Calls of implanted females and castrated non implanted males were shorter than those of castrated implanted and intact non implanted males. Audiograms measured before hormone implants showed dips of enhanced sensitivity at about 0.5, 0.9 and 3.0 {kHz} in males and females. After {AVT} injection, thresholds at frequencies within the 0.7-1.5 {kHz} range were increased in castrated males. Such reduction in sensitivity points to an inhibition of the auditory system during hormone induced vocal activation.},

	abstract = {In animals, the expression of diverse reproductive behaviors is hormonally regulated. In particular, vocalizing during courtship has been related to circulating androgen levels, and reciprocally, conspeciﬁc vocalizations are known to modulate androgen secretion in vertebrates. The eﬀect of natural sounds of abiotic origin on hormonal status has virtually not received attention. Therefore, we evaluated the vocal responses of male Batrachyla taeniata frogs to conspeciﬁc chorus and rainfall sounds in natural and controlled laboratory settings, measuring the testosterone levels of exposed individuals. In ﬁeld and laboratory conditions, testosterone levels of frogs exposed to 31.5 min of chorus and rain sounds and non-exposed individuals were similar. In the ﬁeld, frogs increased their call rate in response to playbacks of chorus and rain sound, but the evoked calling activity was unrelated to plasma testosterone. In contrast to the ﬁeld, frogs showed limited responsiveness to 31.5-min acoustic exposures in the laboratory. Similarly to the ﬁeld, for vocally active males tested in the laboratory there was no association between call rate and testosterone levels. Additionally, in this group, testosterone levels were higher in vocally active males relative to non-calling individuals. Overall, these results indicate that in B. taeniata testosterone levels are not altered following a short-term exposure to conspeciﬁc biotic and to abiotic sounds. Our results are suggestive of a threshold inﬂuence of testosterone on the vocal activity of the species studied. Further explorations of the inﬂuence of abiotic sounds on endocrine activation are required to understand how animals respond to variable acoustic environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {In many species of birds, expression of male–male aggression during breeding elicits increased secretion of testosterone. Elevations in testosterone in turn enhance expression of aggressive behavior in appropriate contexts. However, in other species, the relationship between elevated plasma testosterone and aggressive behavior is subtle or nonexistent. We examined the relationship between high testosterone and male–male aggression in the chestnut-collared longspur, a species in which males exhibit a peak in testosterone early in the breeding season that declines to a breeding baseline after nests are initiated. Elevated testosterone enhances sexual behavior after nests are initiated, but does not aﬀect care of nestlings. We used simulated territorial intrusions ({STIs}) to test (1) if males increased testosterone secretion after an aggressive interaction early in the breeding season (2) if expression of aggressive behavior declined as testosterone levels declined to the breeding baseline, and (3) if experimentally elevated testosterone enhanced aggression when testosterone levels were at the breeding baseline. Plasma testosterone was unrelated to duration of {STI} before nests were initiated. In addition, although males were signiﬁcantly more aggression prior to nest initiation than during incubation, elevation of plasma testosterone to pre-nesting levels did not enhance aggression during incubation. Thus, although elevated plasma testosterone and expression of aggressive behavior appear to overlap temporally, high plasma testosterone and male–male aggression may not be fully coupled in this species. We suggest that high plasma testosterone may be more important in eliciting and maintaining sexual behavior than aggressive behavior in this species.},

The first reports of amphibian parental care date from the early 18th century, when Maria Sibylla Merian went on a field expedition in Suriname and reported frog metamorphs emerging from their mother’s dorsal skin. Reports of this and other parental behaviors in amphibians remained descriptive for decades, often as side notes during expeditions with another purpose. However, since the 1980s, experimental approaches have proliferated, providing detailed knowledge about the adaptive value of observed behaviors. Today, we recognize more than 30 types of parental care in amphibians, but most studies focus on just a few families and have favored anurans over urodeles and caecilians. Here, we provide a synthesis of the last three centuries of parental care research in the three orders comprising the amphibians. We draw attention to the progress from the very first descriptions to the most recent experimental studies, and highlight the importance of natural history observations as a source of new hypotheses and necessary context to interpret experimental findings. We encourage amphibian parental care researchers to diversify their study systems to allow for a more comprehensive perspective of the behaviors that amphibians exhibit. Finally, we uncover knowledge gaps and suggest new avenues of research using a variety of disciplines and approaches that will allow us to better understand the function and evolution of parental care behaviors in this diverse group of animals.},

	abstract = {Among anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), there are two types of polyandry: simultaneous polyandry, where sperm from multiple males compete to fertilize eggs, and sequential polyandry, where eggs from a single female are fertilized by multiple males in a series of temporally separate mating events, and sperm competition is absent. Here we review the occurrence of sequential polyandry in anuran amphibians, outline theoretical explanations for the evolution of this mating system and discuss potential evolutionary implications. Sequential polyandry has been reported in a limited number of anurans, but its widespread taxonomic and geographic distribution suggests it may be common. There have been no empirical studies that have explicitly investigated the evolutionary consequences of sequential polyandry in anurans, but species with this mating pattern share an array of behavioural, morphological and physiological characteristics, suggesting that there has been common sexual selection on their reproductive system. Sequential polyandry may have a number of adaptive beneﬁts, including spreading the risk of brood failure in unpredictable environments, insuring against male infertility, or providing genetic beneﬁts, either through good genes, intrinsic compatibility or genetic diversity effects. Anurans with sequential polyandry provide untapped opportunities for innovative research approaches that will contribute signiﬁcantly to understanding anuran evolution and also, more broadly, to the development of sexual-selection and life-history theory.},

	abstract = {This article is part of a Special Issue (Parental Care). Although paternal care is generally rare among vertebrates, care of eggs and young by male birds is extremely common and may take on a variety of forms across species. Thus, birds provide ample opportunities for investigating both the evolution of and the proximate mechanisms underpinning diverse aspects of fathering behavior. However, signiﬁcant gaps remain in our understanding of the endocrine and neuroendocrine inﬂuences on paternal care in this vertebrate group. In this review, I focus on proximate mechanisms of paternal care in birds. I place an emphasis on speciﬁc hormones that vary predictably and/or unpredictably during the parental phase in both captive and wild birds: prolactin and progesterone are generally assumed to enhance paternal care, whereas testosterone and corticosterone are commonly—though not always correctly—assumed to inhibit paternal care. In addition, because endocrine secretions are not the sole mechanistic inﬂuence on paternal behavior, I also explore potential roles for certain neuropeptide systems (speciﬁcally the oxytocin–vasopressin nonapeptides and gonadotropin inhibitory hormone) and social and experiential factors in inﬂuencing paternal behavior in birds. Ultimately, mechanistic control of fathering behavior in birds is complex, and I suggest speciﬁc avenues for future research with the goal of narrowing gaps in our understanding of this complexity. Such avenues include (1) experimental studies that carefully consider not only endocrine and neuroendocrine mechanisms of paternal behavior, but also the ecology, phylogenetic history, and social context of focal species; (2) investigations that focus on individual variation in both hormonal and behavioral responses during the parental phase; (3) studies that investigate mechanisms of maternal and paternal care independently, rather than assuming that the mechanistic foundations of care are similar between the sexes; (4) expansion of work on interactions of the neuroendocrine system and fathering behavior to a wider array of paternal behaviors and taxa (e.g., currently, studies of the interactions of testosterone and paternal care largely focus on songbirds, whereas studies of the interactions of corticosterone, prolactin, and paternal care in times of stress focus primarily on seabirds); and (5) more deliberate study of exceptions to commonly held assumptions about hormone–paternal behavior interactions (such as the prevailing assumptions that elevations in androgens and glucocorticoids are universally disruptive to paternal care). Ultimately, investigations that take an intentionally integrative approach to understanding the social, evolutionary, and physiological inﬂuences on fathering behavior will make great strides toward reﬁning our understanding of the complex nature by which paternal behavior in birds is regulated.},

	abstract = {Physical gestures are prominent features of many species’ multimodal displays, yet how evolution incorporates body and leg movements into animal signaling repertoires is unclear. Androgenic hormones modulate the production of reproductive signals and sexual motor skills in many vertebrates; therefore, one possibility is that selection for physical signals drives the evolution of androgenic sensitivity in select neuromotor pathways. We examined this issue in the Bornean rock frog (
              Staurois parvus,
              family: Ranidae). Males court females and compete with rivals by performing both vocalizations and hind limb gestural signals, called “foot flags.” Foot flagging is a derived display that emerged in the ranids after vocal signaling. Here, we show that administration of testosterone (T) increases foot flagging behavior under seminatural conditions. Moreover, using quantitative {PCR}, we also find that adult male
              S. parvus
              maintain a unique androgenic phenotype, in which androgen receptor ({AR}) in the hind limb musculature is expressed at levels ∼10× greater than in two other anuran species, which do not produce foot flags (
              Rana pipiens
              and
              Xenopus laevis
              ). Finally, because males of all three of these species solicit mates with calls, we accordingly detect no differences in {AR} expression in the vocal apparatus (larynx) among taxa. The results show that foot flagging is an androgen-dependent gestural signal, and its emergence is associated with increased androgenic sensitivity within the hind limb musculature. Selection for this novel gestural signal may therefore drive the evolution of increased {AR} expression in key muscles that control signal production to support adaptive motor performance.},

In order to determine the time course of this increase following an agonistic challenge, male song sparrows, Zonotrichia (= Melospiza) melodia, were exposed to simulated territorial intrusions. Responding males were captured at intervals after onset of the intrusion for up to 60 min. Plasma levels of T were elevated by 10 min after onset of the challenge, and remained high in birds sampled 10-60 min after onset of the intrusion. In addition, plasma levels of luteinizing hormone ({LH}) increased and were significantly elevated after 10 min of stimulation. The results suggest that at least the prolonged elevation of T secretion precipitated by a male-male interaction was mediated via an increase in {LH} release. However, the initial surge of T levels in plasma may be {LH} independent.},

In vertebrates, the neuroendocrine stress system, comprised of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal/interrenal glands ({HPA}/{HPI} axis) plays a central role in adaptive stress responses. Corticotropin-releasing factor ({CRF}) is the primary hypothalamic neurohormone regulating the {HPA}/{HPI} axis. {CRF} also functions as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the limbic system and brain stem to coordinate endocrine, behavioral, and autonomic responses to stressors. Glucocorticoids, the end products of the {HPA}/{HPI} axis, cause feedback regulation at multiple levels of the stress axis, exerting direct and indirect actions on {CRF} neurons. The spatial expression patterns of {CRF}, and stressor-dependent {CRF} gene activation in the central nervous system ({CNS}) are evolutionarily conserved. This suggests conservation of the gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie tissue-{speciWc} and stressor-dependent {CRF} expression. Comparative genomic analysis showed that the proximal promoter regions of vertebrate {CRF} genes are highly conserved. Several cis regulatory elements and trans acting factors have been implicated in stressor-dependent {CRF} gene activation, including cyclic {AMP} response element binding protein ({CREB}), activator protein 1 ({AP}-1/Fos/Jun), and nerve growth factor induced gene B ({NGFI}-B). Glucocorticoids, acting through the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, either repress or promote {CRF} expression depending on physiological state and {CNS} region. In this review, we take a comparative/evolutionary approach to understand the physiological regulation of {CRF} gene expression. We also discuss evolutionarily conserved molecular mechanisms that operate at the level of {CRF} gene transcription.},

Although the {GR} has been intensively studied in mammals, very little is known about the {GR} in nonmammalian tetrapods. We analyzed the distribution and {GC} regulation of {GR} in the brain of the frog Xenopus laevis by immunohistochemistry. {GR}-immunoreactive ({GR}-ir) cells were widely distributed, with the highest densities in the medial pallium (mp; homolog of the mammalian hippocampus), accumbens, anterior preoptic area ({POA}; homolog of the mammalian paraventricular nucleus), Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum, and rostral anterior pituitary gland (location of corticotropes). Lower but distinct {GR}-ir was observed in the internal granule cell layer of the olfactory bulbs, dorsal and lateral pallium, striatum, various subﬁelds of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ({BNST}), optic tectum, various tegmental nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, reticular nuclei, and the nuclei of the trigeminal motor nerves. Treatment with corticosterone ({CORT}) for 4 days signiﬁcantly decreased {GR}-ir in the {POA}, mp, medial amygdala ({MeA}), {BNST}, and rostral pars distalis. Treatment with the corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor metyrapone ({MTP}) also signiﬁcantly reduced {GR}-ir in the {POA}, mp, {MeA} and {BNST}, but not in the rostral pars distalis. Replacement with a low dose of {CORT} in {MTP}-treated animals reversed these effects in brain. Thus, chronic increase or decrease in circulating corticosteroids reduces {GR}-ir in regions of the frog brain. Our results show that the central distribution of {GR}-ir and regulation by corticosteroids are highly conserved among vertebrates. J. Comp. Neurol. 508:967–982, 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Many animals use information acquired from recent experiences to modify their responses to new situations. Animals’ decisions in contests also depend on their previous experience: after recent victories individuals tend to behave more aggressively and after defeats more submissively. Although these winner and/or loser effects have been reported for animals of different taxa, they have only recently been shown to be flexible traits, which can be influenced by extrinsic factors. In a mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), for instance, individuals which lost an earlier contest were more likely than others to alter contest decisions after a recent win/loss. This result suggests that individuals perceiving themselves to have worse fighting abilities are more inclined to adjust contest strategy based on new information. If this is the case, an individual’s propensity to modify behaviour after a win/loss might also be modulated by intrinsic mechanisms related to its ability to fight. Stress and sex steroid hormones are often associated with an individual’s contest behaviour and performance, so, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that an individual’s propensity to change behaviour after wins or losses also depends on its hormonal state.
Results: Our results show that an individual’s propensity to adjust contest decisions after wins and losses does depend on its hormonal state: individuals with lower levels of cortisol (F), testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone ({KT}) are more receptive than others to the influence of recent contest experiences, especially losing experiences, and the influences last longer. Furthermore, although winning and losing experiences resulted in significant changes in behaviour, they did not bring about a significant change in the levels of F, T, {KT} or oestradiol (E2).
Conclusions: This study shows that an individual’s receptivity to the influence of recent wins and losses is modulated by its internal state, as well as by extrinsic factors. Individuals with hormonal profiles corresponding to lower aggressiveness and a reduced likelihood of winning were more likely to alter contest decisions after a recent win/loss. The results also suggest that F, T, {KT} and E2 are not the primary physiological mechanisms mediating winner-loser effects in this fish.},

To a large extent, handicap hypotheses have relied on energetic explanations for these costs. Here, we have presented a phenomenological model, operating on an intraspecific level, which views the cost of secondary sexual development from an endocrinological perspective. The primary androgenic hormone, testosterone, has a dualistic effect; it stimulates development of characteristics used in sexual selection while reducing immunocompetence. This "double-edged sword" creates a physiological trade-off that influences and is influenced by parasite burden. We propose a negative-feedback loop between signal intensity and parasite burden by suggesting that testosterone-dependent signal intensity is a plastic response. This response is modified in accordance with the competing demands of the potential costs of parasite infection versus that of increased reproductive success afforded by exaggerated signals. We clarify how this trade-off is intimately involved in the evolution of secondary sexual characteristics and how it may explain some of the equivocal empirical results that have surfaced in attempts to quantify parasite's effect on sexual selection.},

	abstract = {The Challenge Hypothesis (Wingﬁeld et al. Am. Nat. 136, 829-846) aims to explain the complex relationship between androgens and social interactions. Despite its well acceptance in the behavioral endocrinology literature, several studies have failed to found an androgen response to staged social interactions. Possible reasons for these inconsistencies are the use of single sampling points that may miss the response peak, and the occurrence of inter-individual variability in the androgen response to social interactions. In this study we addressed these two possible confounding factors by characterizing the temporal pattern of the androgen response to social interactions in the African cichlid, Oreochromis mossambicus, and relating it to inter-individual variation in terms of the individual scope for androgen response (i.e. the diﬀerence between baseline and maximum physiological levels for each ﬁsh) and behavioral types. We found that the androgen response to territorial intrusions varies between individuals and is related to their scope for response. Individuals that have a lower scope for androgen response did not increase androgens after a territorial intrusion but were more aggressive and exploratory. In contrast males with a higher scope for response had fewer aggressive and exploratory behaviors and exhibited two peaks of {KT}, an early response 2–15 min after the interaction and a late response at 60–90 min post-interaction. Given that the pharmacological challenge of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Gonad axis only elicits the late response, we suggest that these two peaks may be regulated by diﬀerent physiological mechanisms, with the early response being mediated by direct brain-gonad neural pathways. In summary, we suggest that determining the temporal pattern of the androgen response to social interactions and considering inter-individual variation may be the key to understanding the contradictory results of the Challenge Hypothesis.},

              The apparent ability of plasma testosterone (T) and corticosterone (B) levels to fluctuate rapidly in response to agonistic interactions, suggests that these hormones may play an important role in an animal's acute behavioural response during such interactions. In the present study, free-living male great tits, Parus major, were subjected to a simulated territorial intrusion ({STI}) during the egg laying, incubation and nestling stage of first broods. Plasma T and B levels of challenged males were compared to those of control males matched for breeding stage, day in breeding stage, and time of day. Plasma B levels were significantly higher in challenged males compared to control males during the egg laying and incubation stage but not during the nestling stage. On the other hand, challenged males had significantly lower plasma T levels than control males throughout the breeding cycle. While having low plasma T and elevated plasma B levels, challenged males showed a vigorous and unrelenting territorial response to the {STI}. Plasma T and B levels of challenged males did not correlate with the intensity of the behavioural response to the {STI}. These findings do not agree with the predictions of the 'challenge hypothesis' that males exposed to a territorial challenge while having breeding baseline T levels will respond with an increase in T or that T correlates with the intensity of aggression during a challenge. Together, our findings suggest a role for B rather than T in the regulation of territorial defence in male great tits.},

	abstract = {Plasma testosterone increases during breeding in many male vertebrates and has long been implicated in the promotion of aggressive behaviors relating to territory and mate defense. Males of some species also defend territories outside of the breeding period. For example, the European nuthatch (Sitta europaea) defends an all-purpose territory throughout the year. To contribute to the growing literature regarding the hormonal correlates of non-breeding territoriality, we investigated the seasonal testosterone and corticosterone proﬁle of male (and female) nuthatches and determined how observed hormone patterns relate to expression of territorial aggression. Given that non-breeding territoriality in the nuthatch relates to the reproductive context (i.e., defense of a future breeding site), we predicted that males would exhibit surges in plasma testosterone throughout the year. However, we found that males showed elevated testosterone levels only during breeding. Thus, testosterone of gonadal origin does not appear to be involved in the expression of non-breeding territoriality. Interestingly, territorial behaviors of male nuthatches were stronger in spring than in autumn, suggesting that in year-round territorial species, breeding-related testosterone elevations may upregulate male–male aggression above non-breeding levels. In females, plasma testosterone was largely undetectable. We also examined effects of simulated territorial intrusions ({STIs}) on testosterone and corticosterone levels of breeding males. We found that {STIs} did not elicit a testosterone response, but caused a dramatic increase in plasma corticosterone. These data support the hypothesis that corticosterone rather than testosterone may play a role in the support of behavior and/or physiology during acute territorial encounters in single-brooded species.},

	abstract = {The “challenge hypothesis” posits that when established social orders are challenged, plasma testosterone (T) in socially monogamous breeding male birds will temporarily increase to facilitate aggressive responses. However, not all birds conform to predictions. To expand upon past ﬁndings, we examined effects of direct territorial challenge on T levels in the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus). We found that simulated territorial intrusions caused a decline in plasma T during both territory establishment and laying/incubation. Conversely, corticosterone ({CORT}) levels dramatically increased. We also examined challenged blue tit males for levels of corticosterone-binding globulin ({CBG}), a carrier molecule that displays afﬁnity for both {CORT} and T in birds. Although the {CBG} showed increased occupation by {CORT} during challenge, effects were not accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in the unbound T fraction. Thus, competitive hormone interactions on the {CBG} do not seem sufﬁcient to explain changes in circulating T levels. To place our results within the context of past ﬁndings, we compared all socially monogamous birds tested to date for plasma levels of T during situational territorial intrusion experiments. We found that birds raising only one brood per season (e.g., the blue tit) consistently show no increase in plasma T but instead show elevations in circulating {CORT}. Thus, we suggest that single-broodedness plays an important role in determining patterns of hormone change and should be considered in future discussions of hormone-behavior interactions.},

Several generalizations were supported by the data. The widely foraging species of frogs made more prey capture attempts in total and took more prey at each feeding station than did the sedentary species. The widely foraging species had higher capacities for aerobic metabolism and lower anaerobic capacities than did the sedentary species. Other generalizations were not supported. Dietary habits were only loosely related to foraging mode and neither aerobic capacity nor foraging mode was a good predictor of the frequency of vocalization or of agonistic behaviour. High aerobic capacity and widely foraging behaviour may be derived characters in the family Dendrobatidae, but the metabolic and behavioural requirements of territorial defence provide an alternate hypothesis for the association of some ecological and physiological characteristics of frogs.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin ({AVT}) are sexually dimorphic in some regions of the bullfrog brain. Since these differences in {AVT} content may be due to sexual differences in plasma steroid concentrations, we performed a gonadectomy-steroid replacement experiment (30-day treatment) to assess the effects of specific steroids on {AVT} concentrations (determined by {RIA}) in adult male and female bullfrogs \textit{(Rana catesbeiana}). These treatments had significant effects in six brain areas. Gonad removal decreased {AVT} concentrations in the amygdala pars lateralis, septal nucleus and habenula of both sexes. Gonadectomy decreased {AVT} content in optic tectum, torus semicircularis and pretrigeminal nucleus of males only. Dihydrotestosterone treatment resulted in {AVT} concentrations at or above sham levels in all six areas, whether or not gonadectomy decreased content. Estradiol fully restored {AVT} concentrations only in the septal nucleus and habenula (of both sexes) and in the amygdala of females. Estradiol partially restored {AVT} levels in the amygdala of males. These results indicate that the gonads maintain {AVT} concentrations in several brain areas and that steroids can modulate levels of {AVT} in bullfrog brain. Effects of each steroid vary depending upon the region and sex of the frog. {AVT} cells are present in three of these regions – the amygdala pars lateralis, septal nucleus and pretrigeminal nucleus. Steroids may be directly affecting {AVT} synthesis in these cells and these populations may be the source of {AVT} fibers in the other steroid-sensitive areas.},

For this method, containment-water is assayed for hormones released by the animal. Originally developed in fish, the method has expanded to amphibians, but requires additional species-specific validations. We wanted to determine physiological relevance of water-borne corticosterone in spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) by comparing concentrations to those taken using established corticosterone sampling methods, such as plasma. Using a mixture of field and laboratory studies, we compared water-borne corticosterone levels to other traditional methods of sampling corticosterone for spotted salamander larvae, metamorphs, and adults. Despite multiple attempts, and detecting differences between age groups, we found no correlations between water-borne and plasma corticosterone levels in any age group. Water-borne sampling measures a rate of release; whereas plasma is the concentration circulating in the blood. The unique units of measurement may inherently prevent correlations between the two. These two methods may also require different interpretations of the data and the physiological meaning. We also note caveats with the method, including how to account for differences in body size and life history stages. Collectively, our results illustrate the importance of careful validation of water-borne hormone levels in each species in order to understand its physiological significance.},

F., 1990. The ‘‘challenge hypothesis”: theoretical implications for patterns of testosterone secretion, mating systems, and breeding strategies. Am. Nat. 136, 829–846] predicts that seasonal patterns in circulating androgen concentrations vary as a function of mating system, male–male aggression and paternal care. In most comparative studies, the predictions of the Challenge Hypothesis have been tested primarily by calculating the ratio between breeding peak and breeding baseline testosterone concentrations, using this ratio as a proxy for the effect that social interactions have on testosterone levels (androgen responsiveness R). Recently, we suggested that it is preferable to separate the seasonal testosterone response (Rseason) from the androgen responsiveness to male–male interactions (Rmale–male), as these two measures do not correlate and can differ both in magnitude and direction [Goymann, W., Landys, M.M., Wingﬁeld, J.C., 2007. Distinguishing seasonal androgen responses from male–male androgen responsiveness—revisiting the Challenge Hypothesis. Horm. Behav. 51, 463–476]. Here, I discuss several methodological and ecological factors that may explain why Rseason and Rmale–male differ. Furthermore, I describe three other kinds of androgen responsiveness, namely the androgen responsiveness of males to receptive females (Rmale–female), to non-social environmental cues (Renvironment), and the potential androgen responsiveness (Rpotential). The latter is measured before and after an injection of gonadotropin releasing hormone ({GnRH}), which typically leads to a maximal release of testosterone from the testes. I argue that separation of different kinds of androgen responsiveness and putting them into context with the natural history and ecology of a study species may help to better understand variations in androgen responsiveness to social and non-social environmental factors. On an ultimate level this may help to better understand the beneﬁts and costs of increasing, or not increasing testosterone concentrations during social interactions. Proximately, this will aid in a more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which testosterone regulates behavioral traits and by which behavior feeds back on hormone levels.},

	abstract = {The Challenge Hypothesis was developed to explain why and how regulatory mechanisms underlying patterns of testosterone secretion vary so much across species and populations as well as among and within individuals. The hypothesis has been tested many times over the past 30 years in all vertebrate groups as well as some invertebrates. Some experimental tests supported the hypothesis but many did not. However, the emerging concepts and methods extend and widen the Challenge Hypothesis to potentially all endocrine systems, and not only control of secretion, but also transport mechanisms and how target cells are able to adjust their responsiveness to circulating levels of hormones independently of other tissues. The latter concept may be particularly important in explaining how tissues respond diﬀerently to the same hormone concentration. Responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonad ({HPG}) axis to environmental and social cues regulating reproductive functions may all be driven by gonadotropin-releasing hormone ({GnRH}) or gonadotropin-inhibiting hormone ({GnIH}), but the question remains as to how diﬀerent contexts and social interactions result in stimulation of {GnRH} or {GnIH} release. These concepts, although suspected for many decades, continue to be explored as integral components of environmental endocrinology and underlie fundamental mechanisms by which animals, including ourselves, cope with a changing environment. Emerging mass spectrometry techniques will have a tremendous impact enabling measurement of multiple steroids in speciﬁc brain regions. Such data will provide greater spatial resolution for studying how social challenges impact multiple steroids within the brain. Potentially the Challenge Hypothesis will continue to stimulate new ways to explore hormone-behavior interactions and generate future hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Animal tracking and biologging devices record large amounts of data on individual movement behaviors in natural environments. In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as “noise” when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called ‘behavioral syndromes’. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual’s risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.},

For example, the selection of breeding habitats can considerably impact the fitness of both offspring and parents, and therefore, parents should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of available options for their current and future reproductive success. Here, we show that resource-use preferences are shaped by a trade-off between parental effort and offspring safety in a tadpole-transporting frog. In a large-scale in situ experiment, we investigated decision strategies across an entire population of poison frogs that distribute their tadpoles across multiple water bodies. Pool use followed a dynamic and sequential selection process, and transportation became more efficient over time. Our results point to a complex suite of environmental variables that are considered during offspring deposition, which necessitates a highly dynamic and flexible decision-making process in tadpole-transporting frogs.},

When linked to longitudinal population studies, cross-generational pedigrees across wild populations can help answer a wide suite of questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. We used microsatellite markers and exhaustive sampling of two successive adult generations to obtain population-wide estimates of individual reproductive output of males and females in a natural population of the Neotropical frog Allobates femoralis (Aromobatidae), a pan-Amazonian species that features prolonged iteroparous breeding, male territoriality and male parental care. Parentage analysis revealed a polygynandrous mating system in which high proportions of males (35.5\%) and females (56.0\%) produced progeny that survived until adulthood. Despite contrasting reproductive strategies, successfully reproducing males and females had similar numbers of mating partners that sired the adult progeny (both sexes: median 2; range 1–6); the numbers of their offspring that reached adulthood were also similar (both sexes: median 2; range 1–8). Measures of reproductive skew indicate selection on males only for their opportunity to breed. Reproductive success was significantly higher in territorial than in nonterritorial males, but unrelated to territory size in males or to body size in both sexes. We hypothesize that female polyandry in this species has evolved because of enhanced offspring survival when paternal care is allocated to multiple partners.},

In poison frogs (Dendrobatidae), assortative mating has been invoked to explain how new color morphs persist despite the expected homogenizing effects of natural selection. Here, we tested the complementary hypothesis that new morphs arise through hybridization between different color morphs. Speciﬁcally, we (1) reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the studied populations of a dart-poison frog to provide an evolutionary framework, (2) tested whether microsatellite allele frequencies of one putative hybrid population of the polymorphic frog O. histrionica are intermediate between O. histrionica and O. lehmanni, and (3) conducted mate-choice experiments to test whether putatively intermediate females prefer homotypic males over males from the other two populations. Our ﬁndings are compatible with a hybrid origin for the new morph and emphasize the possibility of hybridization as a mechanism generating variation in polymorphic species. Moreover, because coloration in poison frogs is aposematic and should be heavily constrained, our ﬁndings suggest that hybridization can produce phenotypic novelty even in systems where phenotypes are subject to strong stabilizing selection.},

	abstract = {Almost fifty years ago the advent of assay methods to measure circulating levels of hormones revolutionized endocrinology in relation to investigations of free-living and captive animals. This new field “environmental endocrinology” revealed that endocrine profiles in animals in their natural habitat were not only different from captive animals, but often deviated from predictions. It quickly became apparent that the organization and analysis of data from the field should be sorted by life history stages such as for reproductive processes, migration, molt etc. and spaced in time according to natural duration of those processes. Presentation of data by calendar date alone gives much simpler, even misleading, patterns. Stage-organized analyses revealed speciesspecific patterns of hormone secretion and dramatic inter-individual differences. The “Challenge Hypothesis” sparked exploration of these results, which diverged from expectations of hormone-behavior interactions. The hypothesis led to specific predictions about how the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonad axis, and particularly circulating patterns of testosterone, might respond to social challenges such as simulated territorial intrusions. Initially, a group of studies on free-living and captive birds played a key role in the formulation of the hypothesis. Over the decades since, the effects of social challenge and environmental context on hormonal responses have been tested in all vertebrate taxa, including humans, as well as in insects. Although it is now clear that the Challenge Hypothesis in its original form is simplistic, field and laboratory tests of the hypothesis have led to other concepts that have become seminal to the development of environmental endocrinology as a field. In this special issue these developments are addressed and examples from many different taxa enrich the emerging concepts, paving the way for investigations using recent technologies for genetic and transcriptome analyses.},

The transmission of these calls can be affected by many acoustic and environmental characteristics, which can influence the detection and decoding of the signal by the receiver. Calling-perch height has a strong influence on sound propagation and acoustic spacing with neighboring males, but how frogs optimize their calling behavior in this context is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated if and how frogs can adjust the calling energy in the context of acoustic spacing. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between calling-perch height, nearest-neighbor distance, and sound-pressure level in the brilliant-thighed poison frog Allobates femoralis. We found that frogs flexibly adjust the calling amplitude according to the calling-perch height without affecting the effectiveness signal propagation. Accompanying signal propagation experiments demonstrated that calls produced with lower amplitude from higher perches propagate similar to louder calls from the ground. Our results suggest an adjustment to the hypothesis of a general positive effect of calling-perch height on signal effectiveness, where highly territorial frogs adjust their calling behavior to reduce energy expenditure and optimize acoustic communication with conspecifics.},

	abstract = {This review focuses on research into the hormonal control of behaviors in amphibians that was conducted prior to the 21st century. Most advances in this field come from studies of a limited number of species and investigations into the hormonal mechanisms that regulate reproductive behaviors in male frogs and salamanders. From this earlier research, we highlight five main generalizations or conclusions. (1) Based on studies of vocalization behaviors in anurans, testicular androgens induce developmental changes in cartilage and muscles fibers in the larynx and thereby masculinize peripheral structures that influence the properties of advertisement calls by males. (2) Gonadal steroid hormones act to enhance reproductive behaviors in adult amphibians, but causal relationships are not as well established in amphibians as in birds and mammals. Research into the relationships between testicular androgens and male behaviors, mainly using castration/steroid treatment studies, generally supports the conclusion that androgens are necessary but not sufficient to enhance male behaviors. (3) Prolactin acts synergistically with androgens and induces reproductive development, sexual behaviors, and pheromone production. This interaction between prolactin and gonadal steroids helps to explain why androgens alone sometimes fail to stimulate amphibian behaviors. (4) Vasotocin also plays an important role and enhances specific types of behaviors in amphibians (frog calling, receptivity in female frogs, amplectic clasping in newts, and non-clasping courtship behaviors). Gonadal steroids typically act to maintain behavioral responses to vasotocin. Vasotocin modulates behavioral responses, at least in part, by acting within the brain on sensory pathways that detect sexual stimuli and on motor pathways that control behavioral responses. (5) Corticosterone acts as a potent and rapid suppressor of reproductive behaviors during periods of acute stress. These rapid stress-induced changes in behaviors use non-genomic mechanisms and membrane-associated corticosterone receptors.},

	title = {Contractile properties of tree frog muscles},
	volume = {202},
	abstract = {Summary The sound-producing muscles of frogs and toads are interesting because they have been selected to produce high-power outputs at high frequencies. The two North American species of gray tree frog, Hyla chrysoscelis and Hyla versicolor, are a diploid–tetraploid species pair. They are morphologically identical, but differ in the structure of their advertisement calls. H. chrysoscelis produces very loud pulsed calls by contracting its calling muscles at approximately 40 Hz at 20 °C, whereas, H. versicolor operates the homologous muscles at approximately 20 Hz at this temperature. This study examined the matching of the intrinsic contractile properties of the calling muscles to their frequency of use. I measured the isotonic and isometric contractile properties of two calling muscles, the laryngeal dilator, which presumably has a role in modulating call structure, and the external oblique, which is one of the muscles that provides the mechanical power for calling. I also examined the properties of the sartorius as a representative locomotor muscle. The calling muscles differ greatly in twitch kinetics between the two species. The calling muscles of H. chrysoscelis reach peak tension in a twitch after approximately 15 ms, compared with 25 ms for the same muscles in H. versicolor. The muscles also differ signiﬁcantly in isotonic properties in the direction predicted from their calling frequencies. However, the maximum shortening velocities of the calling muscles of H. versicolor are only slightly lower than those of the comparable muscles of H. chrysoscelis. The calling muscles have similar maximum shortening velocities to the sartorius, but have much ﬂatter force–velocity curves, which may be an adaptation to their role in cyclical power output. I conclude that twitch properties have been modiﬁed more by selection than have intrinsic shortening velocities. This difference corresponds to the differing roles of shortening velocity and twitch kinetics in determining power output at differing frequencies.},

	abstract = {In anurans, circulating levels of androgens influence certain secondary sexual characteristics that are expressed only during the breeding season. We studied the contractile properties of external oblique muscles (used to power sound production) in a species of North American gray tree frog, Hyla chrysoscelis, during the breeding season and also in testosterone-treated captive males and females after the breeding season. Compared with the muscles of breeding-season males, the trunk muscles of postbreeding-season males have 50\% less mass, 60\% longer twitches, and 40\% slower shortening velocities. Testosterone levels similar to those found in breeding-season male hylid frogs restore the contractile speed and mass of male trunk muscles and also convert the small slow trunk muscles of females into larger fast-contracting muscles. We conclude that androgens likely play a key role in altering the contractile properties of these muscles in males during the annual cycle, allowing them to operate in the breeding season at the frequencies required to produce the characteristic rapidly pulsed calls of this species. Females as well as nonbreeding-season males do not produce advertising calls, and therefore the slower muscles found in these animals may allow more economic operation of these muscles. The effects of testosterone on female trunk muscles indicate the potential of this hormone in contributing to the sexual dimorphism in size and contractile properties of these muscles, but this dimorphism is likely due to the interaction of more than one hormone.},

	abstract = {Hormones play a critical role in the regulation of vertebrate mating behavior, including receptivity, and several components of mate choice. However, less is known about the role of these chemical messengers in mediating behavior associated with premating reproductive isolation. The bisexual–unisexual mating complex of sailﬁn mollies, Poecilia latipinna, and Amazon mollies, Poecilia formosa (sexual parasites of sailﬁns) has been a model system for studying ultimate mechanisms of species recognition. However proximate mechanisms, such as variation in hormone levels, have not been examined. We paired male sailﬁn mollies with either female conspeciﬁcs or Amazon mollies and obtained water-borne hormone samples before and after mating for all ﬁsh. We measured 11-ketotestosterone, testosterone, and estradiol from the water samples. As expected from previous studies, males mated with conspeciﬁcs more frequently than with Amazon mollies. 11-Ketotestosterone production by males increased when they mated with female sailﬁn mollies who themselves also showed elevated production of 11-ketotestosterone. This increase in male and female 11-ketotestosterone levels was not seen when males mated with Amazon mollies. This unique endocrine interaction represents a potential proximate mechanism for species recognition by male sailﬁn mollies. We found no signiﬁcant change in testosterone or estradiol under these conditions suggesting that a single hormone mediates bidirectional interactions between males and females during courtship.},

	abstract = {Evaluating corticosterone ({CORT}) responses to stress in free-living vertebrates requires knowing the unstressed titers prior to capture. Based upon laboratory data, the assumption has been that samples collected in less than 3 min of capture will reflect these unstressed concentrations. This assumption was tested for six species using samples collected from 945 individuals at 0–6 min after capture. Samples were from five avian species trapped at multiple times of year and one reptilian species, comprising a total of 14 different data sets for comparisons. For seven of 14 data sets, including five species, there was no significant increase in corticosterone titers within 3 min of capture. In six of the 14 data sets, corticosterone titers increased significantly after 2 min, and in one data set, the increase started at 1.5 min. In all seven of the cases showing an increase before 3 min, however, corticosterone titers from the time of increase to 3 min were significantly lower than titers after 30 min of restraint stress. These results indicate a high degree of confidence for these species that samples collected in less than 2 min reflect unstressed (baseline) concentrations, and that samples collected from 2–3 min also will likely reflect baseline concentrations but at worst are near baseline.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The ability to relocate home or breeding sites after experimental removal has been observed in several amphibians and the sensory basis of this behavior has been studied in some temperate-region species. However, the actual return trajectories have rarely been quantified in these studies and it remains unknown how different cues guide the homing behavior. Dendrobatidae (dart-poison frogs) exhibit some of the most complex spatial behaviors among amphibians, such as territoriality and tadpole transport. Recent data showed that Allobates femoralis, a frog with paternal tadpole transport, successfully returns to the home territories after experimental translocations of up to 400 m. In the present study, we used harmonic direction finding to obtain homing trajectories. Additionally, we quantified the initial orientation of individuals, translocated 10 m to 105 m, in an arena assay.
Results: Tracking experiments revealed that homing trajectories are characterized by long periods of immobility (up to several days) and short periods (several hours) of rapid movement, closely fitting a straight line towards the home territory. In the arena assay, the frogs showed significant homeward orientation for translocation distances of 35 m to 70 m but not for longer and shorter distances.
Conclusions: Our results describe a very accurate homing behavior in male A. femoralis. The straightness of trajectories and initial homeward orientation suggest integration of learned landmarks providing a map position for translocated individuals. Future research should focus on the role of learning in homing behavior and the exact nature of cues being used.},

	abstract = {Behavior of wild vertebrate individuals can vary in response to environmental or social factors. Such withinindividual behavioral variation is often mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Hormones also serve as a basis for among-individual variations in behavior including animal personalities and the degree of responsiveness to environmental and social stimuli. How do relationships between hormones and behavioral traits evolve to produce such behavioral diversity within and among individuals? Answering questions about evolutionary processes generating among-individual variation requires characterizing how specific hormones are related to variation in specific behavioral traits, whether observed hormonal variation is related to individual fitness and, whether hormonal traits are consistent (repeatable) aspects of an individual’s phenotype. With respect to within-individual variation, we need to improve our insight into the nature of the quantitative relationships between hormones and the traits they regulate, which in turn will determine how they may mediate behavioral plasticity of individuals. To address these questions, we review the actions of two steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, in mediating changes in vertebrate behavior, focusing primarily on birds. In the first part, we concentrate on amongindividual variation and present examples for how variation in corticosterone concentrations can relate to behaviors such as exploration of novel environments and parental care. We then review studies on correlations between corticosterone variation and fitness, and on the repeatability over time of corticosterone concentrations. At the end of this section, we suggest that further progress in our understanding of evolutionary patterns in the hormonal regulation of behavior may require, as one major tool, reaction norm approaches to characterize hormonal phenotypes as well as their responses to environments. In the second part, we discuss types of quantitative relationships between hormones and behavioral traits within individuals, using testosterone as an example. We review conceptual models for testosterone-behavior relationships and discuss the relevance of these models for within-individual plasticity in behavior. Next, we discuss approaches for testing the nature of quantitative relationships between testosterone and behavior, concluding that again reaction norm approaches might be a fruitful way forward. We propose that an integration of new tools, especially of reaction norm approaches into the field of behavioral endocrinology will allow us to make significant progress in our understanding of the mechanisms, the functional implications and the evolution of hormone–behavior relationships that mediate variation both within and among individuals. This knowledge will be crucial in light of already ongoing habitat alterations due to global change, as it will allow us to evaluate the mechanisms as well as the capacity of wild populations to adjust hormonallymediated behaviors to altered environmental conditions.},

Nat. 136 (1990), 829). This study focused on the interspeciﬁc predictions of the challenge hypothesis. Comparative methods were used to control for effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among the sampled species. Male androgen data of 84 bird species were collected from literature records on seasonal androgen patterns. From these, the androgen responsiveness ({AR}) was calculated as described in the original challenge hypothesis (i.e., maximum physiological level/breeding baseline). Scatterplots of {AR} versus mating strategy, male–male aggressiveness, and the degree of paternal care conﬁrmed the expected interspeciﬁc patterns. When phylogenetic analyses were performed among all of the sampled species, the effects of paternal investment disappeared while the {AR} remained covarying to a high degree with mating system and male–male aggressiveness. Although these mechanisms may be different at the intraspeciﬁc level, this suggests that interspeciﬁc differences of {AR} in male birds may have evolved in response to changes of mating strategies, rather than in response to altered paternal duties. However, control for phylogeny among the subsample of 32 passerine species revealed that if any paternal investment contributed to the observed variance in {AR}, then the change from “no male incubation” to “male shares incubation duties” represented the most effective, whereas the male’s contribution to feeding offspring did not explain the observed variation of {AR}.},

We conducted ﬁeldwork monthly from July 2008 to March 2010 to locate frogs in marked grids. We photographed individual frogs to register particular patterns of dots on the dorsum that allowed individual recognition. During the rainy season A. ﬂavopicta used a temporary trench inside the inland vegetation (Cerrada˜ o) for tadpole development. The frogs migrated to the margins of the reservoir during the dry season, when the trench dried completely. Frogs measured 24.0 6 4.0 mm (snout–vent length), and mass was 1.6 6 0.5 g (N = 47). Their condition varied among months but not between the two areas used (trench surroundings inland and island shores). Ameerega ﬂavopicta favored speciﬁc food items and preferred Lepidoptera larvae in both areas. The advertisement call was composed of simple notes repeated 102.7 6 7.63 times per min, lasting 166 6 42 msec and spaced by 387 6 66 msec. The breeding period differed from that reported for other areas. This and other aspects of the Pirapitinga population differed from populations studied elsewhere.

For the amphibians the territoriality, the elaborate courtship and other forms of behaviors, seem to be more associated with species that exhibit the pattern of prolonged reproduction. Vocalization is an important biological aspect related to the reproduction and social behavior of the anurans. This is the first study with behavior and calls for the rocket frog, Allobates olfersioides (Lutz, 1925) and we record the territorial and courtship behavior in ethogram, describe and analyze its vocal repertoire and evaluate the climatic influence on the acoustic activity of the species. We observed 18 males of A. olfersioides by animal focal method, recording all individual activities for ten minutes to calculate the frequency of each action exhibited. Additionally, we played a previously recorded advertisement call to individual male frogs for analyze the territorial responses displayed by individual males during the work. For this anuran, we recorded 11 distinct behaviors and analyzed 14 advertisement calls that demonstrated that the call of A. olfersioides is a simple call composed of a single non-pulsed note, the call duration had a mean of 0.02s, the mean of intercall interval was of 0.35s and the dominant frequency presented a mean of 5.67 {kHz}. The period of vocal activity was recorded during almost all months of the study (November 2015 to October 2016), except November and December, where the individuals presented acoustic inactivity. We believe that A. olfersioides presents a continuous reproduction (approximately 10 months), due to the absence of vocalizations during the driest months in November and December. Concerning the behavioral activities, A. olfersioides presents territorialist behavior patterns similar to other species of Aromobatidae, demonstrating the importance of the acoustic and visual signals exhibited by this anuran species of the Atlantic Forest.},

Snout-to-vent length ranges between 14.9–16.1 mm among males and 15.6–16.5 mm among females. The species is distinguished by the light brown background color of dorsum, with irregular dark brown blotches appearing from eye level to the urostyle region. In life, ventral surfaces of males are golden yellow on throat and chest, and white to yellow on abdomen. Ventral surfaces of females are predominantly white, except for light yellow on chin. The dark brown lateral band has a diffuse lower edge ventrolaterally. Dorsal surface of thigh is cream, with a longitudinal dark brown band extending dorsally from vent to knee. Tail musculature of tadpoles is robust, bifurcating dorsally over the body and reaching about two-thirds of the body length. Advertisement calls consist predominantly of continuous pairs of notes, but other note arrangements are also emitted. Notes have ascending frequency modulation and average peak frequency ranging between 5.3–5.9 {kHz}. First and second notes of the same note pair are similar in amplitude, duration and frequency spectrum. Successive note pairs are split by approximately regular silent intervals (0.30–0.49 s). The species lays its eggs inside rolled or folded dead leaves on the leaf litter. Egg capsules and jelly nests are opaque.},

Based on behavioral field observations, conducted between 2008–2017 at three localities, we describe the courtship, mating, parental care behavior and territoriality of the species. Vocal activity is more intense in the morning and during the rainy season. Resident males respond aggressively to other males that invade their territories, whereas females are not territorial. Females are attracted by the advertisement call of males and enter their territories to breed. The male courtship call has a lower frequency than the advertisement call, indicating that males can modulate the frequency characteristics of their vocalizations. Amplexus stimulates the release of oocytes by females. Males attend multiple egg clutches within their territories and transport tadpoles on their backs to aquatic habitats. Males carry up to 60 tadpoles on a single transport event—the largest number ever recorded for Allobates. We did not record male nor female cannibalism of tadpoles. In summary, we found that Allobates paleovarzensis is a polygamous species with uniparental care performed by the male, complex courtship behavior, high fecundity, and territoriality related to male competition for space and females.},

The new species is allopatric to A. femoralis and its known occurrence is restricted to terra-firme forests on the left bank of the upper Madeira River and southeastern State of Acre. This species is distinguished from A. femoralis and from other species in the A. femoralis group by presenting two-note advertisement calls and conspicuous reddish-orange color on ventral surfaces of hind limbs and posterior abdomen. Phylogenetic analyses based on a fragment of the 16S {rRNA} mitochondrial gene suggest the new species is the sister group to a clade referred to as A. femoralis occurring in southern State of Acre, from which it is distinguished by six unambiguous nucleotide substitutions, in addition to exclusive advertisement calls and color patterns. The new species is more distantly related to A. femoralis sensu stricto occurring near the A. femoralis type locality in the Peruvian Amazon. Summarizing evidence from molecular phylogenetic analysis, genetic distances and available data on advertisement calls, we identify one possible case of genetic introgression between lineages in this group and highlight the potential for the description of more species within the A. femoralis complex.},

	abstract = {Recent reviews on sexual dichromatism in frogs included Mannophryne trinitatis as the only example they could find of dynamic dichromatism (males turn black when calling) within the family Aromobatidae and found no example of ontogenetic dichromatism in this group. We demonstrate ontogenetic dichromatism in M. trinitatis by rearing post-metamorphic froglets to near maturity: the throats of all individuals started as grey coloured; at around seven weeks, the throat became pale yellow in some, and more strongly yellow as development proceeded; the throats of adults are grey in males and variably bright yellow in females, backed by a dark collar. We demonstrated the degree of throat colour variability by analysing a large sample of females. The red: green (R:G) ratio ranged from {\textasciitilde}1.1 to 1.4, reflecting variation from yellow to yellow/orange, and there was also variation in the tone and width of the dark collar, and in the extent to which the yellow colouration occurred posterior to the collar. Female M. trinitatis are known to be territorial in behaviour. We show a positive relationship between throat colour (R:G ratio) and escape performance, as a proxy for quality. Our field observations on Tobago’s M. olmonae showed variability in female throat colour and confirmed that males in this species also turn black when calling. Our literature review of the 20 Mannophryne species so far named showed that all females have yellow throats with dark collars, and that male colour change to black when calling has been reported in eight species; in the remaining 12 species, descriptions of males calling are usually lacking so far. We predict that both dynamic and ontogenetic sexual dichromatism are universal in this genus and provide discussion of the ecological role of dichromatism in this genus of predominantly diurnal, non-toxic frogs, with strong paternal care of offspring.},

This frog reproduces in captivity and deposits moderately sized eggs (1.6 mm in diameter) in terrestrial nests. The father guards the embryos until tadpole hatching. We divided development until hatching into 25 stages and implemented methods for in vitro culture of the embryos. The external and internal morphology of embryos were evaluated by observations in whole mount and in sections. Neural, notochord and somite specific antibodies were used to analyze gene expression patterns by immunostaining of embryos. Embryonic development of C. machalilla is slow and deviates from Xenopus laevis. In C. machalilla the elongation of the notochord, neural plate and somite formation occur after blastopore closure, possibly due to a delay in the dorsal convergence and extension movements. The gastrula of C. machalilla also deviates from X. laevis. The archenteron remains small until blastopore closure, where small cells accumulate at the blastopore lips. Simultaneously, the blastocoel roof thins until it becomes a monolayer of cells. Although C. machalilla does not form an embryonic disk, its thick blastopore lips resemble the embryonic disk of the marsupial frog Gastrotheca riobambae and represent an interesting deviation from the gastrulation pattern observed in X. laevis.},

	abstract = {A new species of frog of the genus Hyloxalus from a high Andean forest of the central parts of the Cordillera Oriental, Colombia is recognized and described using integrative taxonomy. Using phylogenetic analyses of 2590 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial {DNA}, Hyloxalus felixcoperari sp. nov. was shown to belong to a lineage of the subpunctatus clade, part of a subgroup that comprises high altitude-occurring lineages (subgroup I) and sister taxa of H. subpunctatus sensu stricto from the Bogotá plateau region. The genetic distance between both taxa is 2.1\% and 5.1\% for the 16S and cytochrome b gene fragments respectively. Hyloxalus felixcoperari sp. nov. is a medium-sized frog, which can be distinguished morphologically from H. subpunctatus by having dark throat and chest and unwebbed toes, and bioacoustically by emitting an advertisement call consisting of trill-like calls repeated at a rate of 50 – 104 repititions/min, with a dominant frequency ranging from 3028.9 – 3861.2 Hz. Molecular dating analysis revealed that the already known lineages of the subpunctatus clade subgroup I from the middle Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, recently diverged during the lower Pleistocene – Upper Pliocene, most probably due to environmental fluctuations. Threats and main aspects of the natural history of this new species including breeding and habitat are reported in this article.},

	abstract = {The bi-directional links between hormones and behavior have been a rich area of research for decades. Theory on the evolution of testosterone (T) was greatly advanced by the challenge hypothesis, which presented a framework for understanding interspecific, seasonal, and social variation in T levels in males, and how they are shaped by the competing demands of parental care and male-male competition. Female competition is also widespread in nature, although it is less clear whether or how the challenge hypothesis applies to females. Here, we evaluate this issue in four parts: (1) We summarize and update prior analyses of seasonal plasticity and interspecific variation in T in females. (2) We evaluate experimental links between T and female aggression on shorter timescales, asking how T manipulations affect aggression and conversely, how social manipulations affect T levels in female mammals, birds, lizards, and fishes. (3) We examine alternative mechanisms that may link aggression to the social environment independently of T levels in circulation. (4) We present a case study, including new data analyses, in an aggressive female bird (the tree swallow, Tachycineta bicolor) to explore how variation in tissue-level processing of T may bridge the gap between circulating T and variation in behavior that is visible to natural selection. We close by connecting these multivariate levels of sex steroid signaling systems alongside different temporal scales (social, seasonal, and evolutionary) to generate broadly applicable insights into how animals respond to their social environment, regardless of whether they are male or female.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Competitive interactions often occur in series; therefore animals may respond to social challenges in ways that prepare them for success in future conflict. Changes in the production of the steroid hormone testosterone (T) are thought to mediate phenotypic responses to competition, but research over the past few decades has yielded mixed results, leading to several potential explanations as to why T does not always elevate following a social challenge. Here, we measured T levels in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a system in which females compete for limited nesting cavities and female aggression is at least partially mediated by T. We experimentally induced social challenges in two ways: (1) using decoys to simulate territorial intrusions and (2) removing subsets of nesting cavities to increase competition among displaced and territory-holding females. Critically, these experiments occurred pre-laying, when females are physiologically capable of rapidly increasing circulating T levels. However, despite marked aggression in both experiments, T did not elevate following real or simulated social challenges, and in some cases, socially challenged females had lower T levels than controls. Likewise, the degree of aggression was negatively correlated with T levels following a simulated territorial intrusion. Though not in line with the idea that social challenges prompt T elevation in preparation for future challenges, these patterns nevertheless connect T to territorial aggression in females. Coupled with past work showing that T promotes aggression, these results suggest that T may act rapidly to allow animals to adaptively respond to the urgent demands of a competitive event.},

	abstract = {Linking speciﬁc ecological factors to the evolution of parental care pattern and mating system is a difﬁcult task of key importance. We provide evidence from comparative analyses that an ecological factor (breeding pool size) is associated with the evolution of parental care across all frogs. We further show that the most intensive form of parental care (trophic egg feeding) evolved in concert with the use of small pools for tadpole deposition and that egg feeding was associated with the evolution of biparental care. Previous research on two Peruvian poison frogs (Ranitomeya imitator and Ranitomeya variabilis) revealed similar life histories, with the exception of breeding pool size. This key ecological difference led to divergence in parental care patterns and mating systems. We present ecological ﬁeld experiments that demonstrate that biparental care is essential to tadpole survival in small (but not large) pools. Field observations demonstrate social monogamy in R. imitator, the species that uses small pools. Molecular analyses demonstrate genetic monogamy in R. imitator, the ﬁrst example of genetic monogamy in an amphibian. In total, this evidence constitutes the most complete documentation to date that a single ecological factor drove the evolution of biparental care and genetic and social monogamy in an animal.},

	abstract = {Northwestern South America is among the most biodiverse, albeit unexplored, regions of the world. The genus Andinobates is made up of 14 species, all distributed in Northwestern South America (Colombia and Northern Ecuador), and adjacent Panamá. Within the last decade, five species of this genus have been described. In this paper we describe yet another species, belonging to the Andinobates fulguritus group, from the Urabá region of Northwestern Colombia. The new species can be distinguished from other members of Andinobates on the basis of a unique combination of coloration, size, and advertisement call parameters. Molecular phylogenetic and genetic distance analyses corroborate the species’ taxonomic affinity, and further support its status as a distinct lineage. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings on the systematics of the A. fulguritus group.},

The Madeira River is the largest tributary of the Amazon River, with the region comprising its basin undergoing complex changes from the Pliocene through the Holocene. Accordingly, the evolution of its drainage seems to have been an important factor in the biological diversification of different taxa. We characterize the phylogeographic pattern of Adelphobates quinquevittatus, focusing on the role of the Madeira River and the environmental changes in the region, as potential barriers to gene flow. For this, we used sequences of two mitochondrial genes from 65 individuals sampled in 15 locations. We identify population structure partially related to the current Madeira River configuration. However the most upstream session does not represent a historical barrier, suggesting that may have attained its current geomorphological configuration recently. Divergence among clades began in the last 1 million years, coinciding with documented changes in this landscape, and may be related to river dynamics associated with the presence of open vegetation areas. This phylogeographic pattern supports the dynamism of the drainage, and the historical complexity of the upper Madeira River.},

	abstract = {Testosterone is assumed to be the key hormone related to resource-defence aggression. While this role has been confirmed mostly in the context of reproduction in male vertebrates, the effect of testosterone on the expression of resource-defence aggression in female vertebrates is not so well established. Furthermore, laboratory work suggests that progesterone inhibits aggressive behaviour in females. In this study, we investigated the hormonal changes underlying territorial aggression in free-living female African black coucals,
              Centropus grillii
              (Aves; Cuculidae). Females of this sex-role reversed polyandrous bird species should be particularly prone to be affected by testosterone because they aggressively defend territories similar to males of other species. We show, however, that territorial aggression in female black coucals is modulated by progesterone. After aggressive territorial challenges female black coucals expressed lower levels of progesterone than unchallenged territorial females and females without territories, suggesting that progesterone may suppress territorial aggression and is downregulated during aggressive encounters. Indeed, females treated with physiological concentrations of progesterone were less aggressive than females with placebo implants. This is one of the first demonstrations of a corresponding hormone–behaviour interaction under challenged and experimental conditions in free-living females. We anticipate that our observation in a sex-role reversed species may provide a more general mechanism, by which progesterone—in interaction with testosterone—may regulate resource-defence aggression in female vertebrates.},

When the hormonal profile of polygynous males is mimicked by the administration of subcutaneous implants of T to males of monogamous species, thus maintaining plasma levels of this androgen at high vernal levels, frequencies of territorial aggression and courtship behavior remain elevated, resulting in a marked increase in the size of the territory. A substantial number of T-implanted males also become polygynous, attracting two and sometimes three females to settle on their enlarged territories. These data suggest strongly that the nature of avian mating systems is regulated proximately by temporal patterns of hormone secretion. Received2 December1983, accepted 27 April 1984.},

Dendrobatid frogs display remarkable parental care which is associated with water bodies (phytotelmata) contained in plants with characteristics that are important to offspring survival. It has been shown that the size of phytotelmata is a key factor that drove the divergence in parental care patterns in poison frogs and that the distribution of reproductive resources can inﬂuence space use in these species. Here, we investigated parental care strategies and the inﬂuence of reproductive resource distribution on space use patterns in a wild population of Andinobates claudiae in Bocas del Toro, Panama. We identiﬁed the phytotelmata characteristics that predict tadpole deposition and analysed the association between the spatial distribution of phytotelmata and spatial use of males and females. Our observations showed that this species mates polygamously and exhibits male parental care. We found that male frogs have smaller kernel density home ranges and core areas compared to females, and that space use is related to the density of Heliconia plants whose axil cavities are used for tadpole rearing. Furthermore, we found that tadpoles were more frequently found in phytotelmata that were at lower heights and contained larger water volumes. Fathers invested time inspecting multiple cavities and travelled further than predicted from their territories to ﬁnd suitable deposition sites. Our observations suggest a selective choice of phytotelmata regarding tadpole deposition, where distribution and quality of cavities might inﬂuence parental care decisions.},

The new species is associated to the bombetes group and characterized by a unique combination of ventral and dorsal color patterns. Data on 1119 bp from two mitochondrial markers allowed us to reject the null hypotheses that A. cassidyhornae sp. nov. is part of the phenotypically similar and geographically less distant species: A. opisthomelas, A. virolinensis or A. bombetes. The best available phylogenetic trees and the genetic distance to other Andinobates species further support this decision. Altogether, the advertisement call parameters unambiguously separated A. cassidyhornae sp. nov. calls from the calls of the three closest species. The new species adds to a poorly known and highly endangered genus of poison frogs that requires further studies and urgent conservation measures.},

Extensive sampling of putative R. fantastica (including near-topotypic material) throughout central Peru, and the resulting morphological and phylogenetic analysis has led us to conclude that R. fantastica sensu lato is a complex of three closely related species rather than a single, widely distributed species. The first of these species occurs near the type locality of R. fantastica but bears significant dissimilarity to the original type series and forms a monophyletic clade that is distributed throughout an expansive lowland zone between Rio Huallaga and Rio Ucayali. This species is diagnosable by its brilliant red head and advertisement call differences. The second new species has long been considered a color morph of R. fantastica, although our analysis shows that it is genetically distinct from even adjacent populations of R. fantastica. This species is restricted to the Huallaga Canyon near Chazuta and is primarily diagnosed on the basis of nucleotide sequences, although it does possess additional morphological and vocal characteristics which are distinct from R. fantastica.},

The daily cycle of calling activity showed peaks in the morning and in the afternoon, and the occurrence of reproductive events was positively correlated with monthly rainfall. The breeding behavior comprised vocal and tactile interactions, although the species lacked reproductive amplexus. Egg and larvae attendance, as well as tadpole transport to water environments was performed mostly by males but occasionally by females, probably in cases of desertion by the father.

	abstract = {Describing natural history of species is important because it would allow us to corroborate hypotheses about evolutionary biology and improve conservations plans. We describe the adver­ tisement call, tadpole morphology, and other natural history aspects of the poison frog Andinobates daleswansoni, an endemic threatened species of the Colombian Andes. The advertisement call consists of multiple pulsed notes, with an average dominant frequency of 4052.81 ± 154.93 Hz. This call sounds similar to the call of other Andinobates frogs, but there are clear differences in spectral and temporal features. Tadpoles have a depressed body, low compressed dorsal and ventral tail fins with a rounded tip. The oral disc has a labial tooth row formula of 2(2)/3(1), and a gap in the marginal papillae of the lower lip, whose status as a synapomorphy for the group A. bombetes is discussed. Like other poison frogs, the diet of A. daleswansoni consists of small arthropods (Acari, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera) that individuals cap­ ture in leaflitter. We recorded tadpole transport by males to phytotelmata in the Elephant Ear plant (Xanthosoma robustum) which demonstrate that A. daleswansoni has a greater niche breadth for tadpole development than previously recorded. Acoustic interactions and physical fights observed during an ago­ nistic behaviour on the part of two males of A. daleswansoni is similar to those recorded in other poison frogs and possible associated to the occupation of resources such as availability of prey items and places for breeding.},

Females were territorial and defended sites with visual displays and aggressive behavior against all intruders. Most females remained at the same sites throughout the study. Males were more mobile and seldom remained in one place for more than a few days. Males turned black when calling and were aggressive only toward other black males. Non-calling males were light brown. Males gave an advertisement call and at least two courtship calls, but lacked agonistic encounter calls. Males carried tadpoles from terrestrial oviposition sites to water. The behavior of C. trinitatis appears to be similar to that of C. collaris and C. palmatus, but differs substantially from that of the Panamanian C. inguinalis.},

As males typically invest less initially into reproduction, they are more likely to trade-off time and energy spent on paternal care for alternative activities such as aggressive territorial defense. Trade-offs between male territorial aggression and male provisioning are well studied in temperate-zone species, but tropical studies are lacking. Tropical passerines may show distinct trade-offs that inﬂuence investment in offspring care, given life history differences such as lower fecundity, slower offspring development, and higher adult survival. We studied trade-offs between paternal care and aggression in an equatorial population of rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis). We hypothesized that males with high territorial aggression would be poor providers. To test this we conducted provisioning observations and simulated territorial intrusions on males during three nestling periods. No direct trade-offs existed between aggression and paternal provisioning. Males provisioned at a lower rate than females overall and nestling body size was positively related to male provisioning rates, suggesting a time/energy trade-off between male and female care. Males may, therefore, invest most into alternative activities. However, males stand to gain ﬁtness beneﬁts from provisioning offspring at a relatively high rate.},

	abstract = {In most Anuran species, space use includes a lek mating system with defense of a calling site for only a short time period during an individual’s lifespan. In contrast, territoriality over a longer time period by one or both of the sexes has been reported in all studied dendrobatid frogs. In most dendrobatid species, territories are defended for reproductive purposes, and typically, males vocalize from these territories to attract mates and repel rivals. It has been hypothesized that reproductive resources such as oviposition sites or tadpole deposition sites are defended. For reproductive resource defense to occur, reproductive units (eggs or tadpoles) must be deposited at sites where the territorial individual displays agonistic interaction with intruding individuals. Here, we challenge this assumption in a field study on the poison frog Dendrobates ventrimaculatus in French Guiana. We show that home-range size is affected by spatial distribution of bromeliads. Clutches of eggs were found to be predominantly deposited in bromeliads located inside the 50\% Kernel core areas of activity within male territories, although tadpoles were deposited more frequently outside these core areas. Vocalization of males only occurred in agonistic interactions with other males or while courting a female. Our data show that (1) males of D. ventrimaculatus defend small territories containing their reproductive resources, (2) these resources are not limited in number, and (3) territories are not defended for characteristics supporting advertisement vocalization. We conclude that males defend territories to increase the success of courting a female without interruption by other males.},

	abstract = {The endemic, dendrobatid frog, Colostethus beebei, lived and bred only in water-filled axils of a giant terrestrial bromeliad, Brocchinia micrantha, at Kaieteur National Park, Guyana, South America. Vocalizations initiate reproduction in frogs, and male C. beebei employed three types: advertisement, territorial encounter, and courtship calls. Males responded aggressively to advertisement calls from strangers played in their territories but vocalized antiphonally in response to calls from neighbors. Male C. beebei spent 40\% of their time-activity budget vocalizing. Females preferred advertisement calls delivered at repetition rates above that of the population mean and from larger males. Courtship was prolonged and included close-range vocal, visual, and tactile stimulation between the sexes. Clutches of four pigmented eggs were laid on leaves above the water of bromeliad tanks. After ovipositing, females spent much time on their mates' territories. Both parents provided care-males tended clutches, moistened eggs with fluid squirted from their cloacae during low humidity times of the day, and transported tadpoles. Tadpoles occasionally fed on unfertilized eggs deposited directly in their pool by their mother. Most tadpole nutrition was obtained by grazing on algal mats and by capturing mobile prey in bromeliad pools. Although we observed con- and heterospecific cannibalism among C. beebei tadpoles, cannibalism seemed to be rare. Overall, our observations suggest that C. beebei exhibits long-term pair bonding and facultative nutritive egg provisioning. These behaviors have not yet been reported for other members of the genus Colostethus but seems essential to C. beebei's obligate life on B. micrantha with its food-limited larval microhabitats. Comparisons with other frog species that feed eggs to their progeny suggests that this strategy is an evolutionarily derived trait in C. beebei.},

	abstract = {Factors contributing to the evolution of reproductive strategies have been of great interest to evolutionary biologists. In tropical amphibians predation and competition have been suggested to play a major role. Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae display a trend towards the use of very small pools and increased parental care, particularly in the genus Dendrobates. Some species with female parental care, asymmetrical biparental care and biparental care, have evolved novel behaviors in association with the use very small phytotelmata. It has been hypothesized that selection pressure imposed by predation and competition favored the use of small phytotelmata, and this, in turn, produced selection for trophic egg provisioning to ameliorate the lack of available nutrients. To elucidate the ecological factors associated with the transition from uniparental male care to biparental care and associated changes in social behaviors, we evaluated key behavioral and ecological differences between Dendrobates imitator and D. variabilis. Dendrobates imitator used signiﬁcantly smaller phytotelmata in different plant species than D. variabilis for tadpole and embryo deposition. The parental strategy of D. variabilis was limited to male parental care, whereas D. imitator exhibited biparental care. Males and females of D. variabilis were observed to have a promiscuous mating system with little mate ﬁdelity. This contrasted with D. imitator, where paired males and females were observed interacting daily and were never observed courting additional mates. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a key ecological difference between these species, involving the size of pools typically used for reproduction, is strongly associated with the evolution of biparental care and monogamy in D. imitator.},

We manipulated breeding pool size in order to demonstrate experimentally that breeding habitat selection strategy has evolved in concert with changes in parental care and mating system. We also manipulated intra- and interspeciﬁc larval interactions to demonstrate that larval adaptation to the use of very small pools for breeding affected the evolution of larval competition and cannibalism.

	abstract = {This issue is dedicated to the late Professor Giovanni Chieﬃ, and this article is an overview of the research on Comparative Endocrinology of reproduction using Rana esculenta (alias Pelophylax esculentus) as a model system. Starting from the early 1970s till today, a large quantity of work have been conducted both in the ﬁelds of experimental endocrinology and in the deﬁnition of the diﬀuse neuroendocrine system, with a major focus on the increasing role of regulatory peptides. The various aspects investigated concerned the histological descriptions of principal endocrine glands of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal ({HPG}) axis, the localization and distribution in the {HPG} of several diﬀerent substances (i.e. neurosteroids, hypothalamic peptide hormones, pituitary gonadotropins, gonadal sex steroids, and other molecules), the determination of sex hormone concentrations in both serum and tissues, the hormone manipulations, as well as the gene and protein expression of steroidogenic enzymes and their respective receptors. All together these researches, often conducted considering diﬀerent periods of the annual reproductive cycle of the green frog, allowed to understand the mechanism of cascade control/regulation of the {HPG} axis of R. esculenta, characterizing the role of diﬀerent hormones in the two sexes, and testing the hypotheses about the function of single hormones in diﬀerent target organs. It becomes evident from the review that, in their simplest form, several features of this species are specular as compared to those of other vertebrate species and that reproduction in this frog species is either under endogenous multi-hormonal control or by a wide array of diﬀerent factors. Our excursus of this research, spanning almost ﬁve decades, shows that R. esculenta has been intensively and successfully used as an animal model in reproductive endocrinology as well as several ﬁeld studies such as those involving environmental concerns that focus on the eﬀects of endocrine disruptors and other environmental contaminants.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of aposematism, or the pairing of antipredator defence with conspicuous or distinctive signals, serves as an excellent example of how traits act in concert to shape fitness. Not only does this complex phenotype require the integration of multiple traits, it alters the fitness pay-offs of yet others. The protection offered by aposematism may, for example, reduce the costs associated with foraging or sexual display. Thus, well-protected aposematic lineages should be bolder, more active and less likely to respond to perceived threats of predation than more cryptic lineages. Comparisons of differently coloured morphs of the polytypic strawberry poison frog (Oophaga pumilio) have supported the predicted behavioural correlates of aposematism, with the exception of those regarding responsiveness to simulated predators. We tested the key prediction that aposematic coloration will be associated with reduced sensitivity to predators in two polymorphic O. pumilio populations. The novel approach of studying polymorphic populations allowed us to assess the effect of colour in the absence of potentially confounding habitat differences. We found that colour was associated with the probability that a frog would attempt escape and the distance at which it fled, but only in one population, and not in the predicted direction. An overall comparison of the two populations superficially supported our predictions, but this pattern actually arose because frogs occupying higher perches were less likely to respond, a pattern that may reflect the value of high perches and the costs associated with returning to them after attempted escape. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between predators and prey, the challenges associated with understanding how and why traits are correlated, and the intimate ties between behaviour and morphological evolution. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag {GmbH}.},

	abstract = {Begging by nestling birds has been used to test evolutionary models of signalling but theory has outstripped evidence. Eavesdropping predators potentially impose a cost on begging that ensures signal honesty, yet little experimental evidence exists for such a cost at active nests because the use of artificial nests, long playback bouts and absence of parents may have exaggerated costs. We broadcast short periods (1 h) of either nestling vocalizations or background noise at active white-browed scrubwren, Sericornis frontalis, nests. Nestlings called naturally during both treatments, allowing us to test whether elevated calling increases risk, a key but rarely tested assumption of evolutionary models. Predators visited nests exclusively during periods of elevated calling. Furthermore, playbacks affected neither adult visits nor nestling activity, suggesting that calling alone attracted predators. Adults gave alarm calls and nestlings usually called less when predators approached nests. Predation risk to broods is, therefore, likely to fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, depending on nestling hunger and whether adults or young have detected predators. This study confirms a present-day cost of nestling begging, demonstrates that this cost can be incurred over short periods and supports the importance of parent–offspring antipredator strategies in reducing predation risk.},

Among vertebrate signals, it is becoming clear that no single stereotyped signal feature reliably elicits species-specific behavior, but rather, that a suite of characters is involved. Within the largely nocturnal clade of anuran amphibians, the dart-poison frog, Epipedobates femoralis, is a diurnal species that physically and vigorously defends its calling territory against conspecific intruders. Here we report that physical attacks by a territorial male are provoked only in response to dynamic bimodal stimuli in which the acoustic playback of vocalizations is coupled with vocal sac pulsations, but not by either unimodal cues presented in isolation or static bimodal stimuli. These results suggest that integration of dynamic bimodal cues is necessary to elicit aggression in this species.},

	abstract = {Sensory systems function most efficiently when processing natural stimuli, such as vocalizations, and it is thought that this reflects evolutionary adaptation. Among the best-described examples of evolutionary adaptation in the auditory system are the frequent matches between spectral tuning in both the peripheral and central auditory systems of anurans (frogs and toads) and the frequency spectra of conspecific calls. Tuning to the temporal properties of conspecific calls is less well established, and in anurans has so far been documented only in the central auditory system. Using auditory-evoked potentials, we asked whether there are species-specific or sex-specific adaptations of the auditory systems of gray treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis) and green treefrogs (H. cinerea) to the temporal modulations present in conspecific calls. Modulation rate transfer functions ({MRTFs}) constructed from auditory steady-state responses revealed that each species was more sensitive than the other to the modulation rates typical of conspecific advertisement calls. In addition, auditory brainstem responses ({ABRs}) to paired clicks indicated relatively better temporal resolution in green treefrogs, which could represent an adaptation to the faster modulation rates present in the calls of this species. {MRTFs} and recovery of {ABRs} to paired clicks were generally similar between the sexes, and we found no evidence that males were more sensitive than females to the temporal modulation patterns characteristic of the aggressive calls used in male–male competition. Together, our results suggest that efficient processing of the temporal properties of behaviorally relevant sounds begins at potentially very early stages of the anuran auditory system that include the periphery.},

To assess the response of males to pre-recorded natural 'chirp' (advertisement call) and natural 'chuckle" (aggressive call) stimuli of gradually increasing broadcast intensity, three parameters (intensity, dominant frequency and repetition rate) of the chirp call were analysed. Of the males tested, 69\% showed a significant increase in chirp intensity with increased levels of both stimulus types. In response to playback of the chirp stimulus, males actively modified the dominant frequency of their chirp calls over a mean range of 91·42 Hz, and in one case as much as 400 Hz. Moreover, 12 of 17 males shifted the frequency of their call towards the dominant frequency of the chirp stimulus (2175 Hz) by either increasing or decreasing the dominant frequency of their chirp calls. In response to the natural chuckle stimulus, 83\% of the males showed either a decrease or no significant change in the dominant frequency of their chirps. All eight males for which both the chirp frequency and intensity were analysed and that showed an increase in chirp intensity also showed a concomitant increase in chirp dominant frequency. These results are the first to document quantitatively the plasticity of advertisement call intensity and dominant frequency in an anuran. The possible effects of advertisement call modification on male mating success in L. albilabris is discussed. © 1988.},

	abstract = {Male Pacific treefrogs, Hyla regilla, use advertisement and encounter calls in their reproductive communication. Encounter calls are produced when a male hears either advertisement or encounter calls at amplitudes that exceed his aggressive threshold for that call type, and they are believed to play a role in male spacing in a chorus. Aggressive thresholds of males for advertisement and encounter calls are plastic; males resume advertisement calling (i.e. accommodate) after repeated exposure to either advertisement or encounter calls that exceed their aggressive thresholds for that call type. Presentation of one call type does not elevate a male's aggressive threshold for the other call type, indicating that discrete neural 'channels' exist for processing advertisement versus encounter calls. Because these calls are spectrally highly similar, it is likely that they are differentiated in the central auditory system on the basis of their different temporal structure; pulses are repeated in advertisement and encounter calls at rates of approximately 100 pulses/s and 30 pulses/s, respectively. The present study tested whether consecutive advertisement-type interpulse intervals ({IPIs}) are required to activate the filter for advertisement calls. Males were accommodated to synthetic stimuli that differed in the proportion of advertisement versus encounter {IPIs}. Aggressive thresholds of males for the encounter call and advertisement call (monophasic type) were elevated 450\% and 58\%, respectively, following accommodation to a stimulus that had nine of each {IPI} type, arranged in an alternating sequence. Aggressive thresholds for the monophasic advertisement call were elevated 151\%, however, when males were accommodated with stimuli that had two sets of eight to nine consecutive advertisement {IPIs}; consistent with previous work, aggressive thresholds for the encounter call were not significantly elevated. Aggressive thresholds for the advertisement call are typically elevated approximately four-fold following accommodation with that call type. These findings are consistent, therefore, with the hypothesis that several consecutive advertisement {IPIs} are required to activate the 'advertisement channel'; if consecutive advertisement {IPIs} were not required, the stimulus that consisted of the same number of advertisement and encounter {IPIs} should have induced comparable elevations of the aggressive thresholds of males for advertisement and encounter calls. Selective filters for the advertisement call, therefore, appear to integrate information across many consecutive 'correct' {IPIs}. This integration process may contribute to a female's call preference. © 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In playback experiments, conducted in choruses of unusually low density, the lowest sound pressure levels at which males vocally responded to a synthetic advertisement call of 2875 Hz ranged from 48 to 71 {dB} {SPL}; the median of 63 {dB} {SPL} is a conservative estimate of the effective threshold for antiphonal calling. The sound pressure levels of the calls of each frog's nearest neighbour ranged from 0 to 36 {dB} {SPL} (median 11 {dB} {SPL}) above its estimated threshold. These values are conservative because background noise precluded testing one-fourth of the forgs at sound pressure levels below 64 {dB} {SPL}.

To investigate how these kinds of information are encoded in mating calls, we carried out two-choice discrimination experiments on female Italian treefrogs, Hyla intermedin, and examined their patterns of call preferences in response to variation in fine-scale temporal properties. We analysed preferences for three fine-scale temporal properties: pulse rate, call duration, and call rise-time. Calls with the mean pulse rate were significantly preferred over alternatives with either higher-than-average or lower-than-average pulse rates. The mean rise-tune call was preferred over alternatives with rise-times either close to or lower than the smallest values recorded in the study population. Unlike pulse rate and rise-time, females did not show significant preferences for calls of similar pulse rate, but different call duration. We compared female preference functions with the patterns of within-bout variation in call properties and used these results to illustrate the interactions between ultimate functions and proximate mechanisms of both call production and recognition in the co-evolutionary process of the treefrog communication system.},

	abstract = {and Summary Males of Uperoleia rugosa called mainly at night in aggregations of regularly distributed males. The advertisement calls had a uniform sound pressure field and their attenuation closely followed the inverse square law, but excess attenuation by absorption and reflection in vegetation also occurred. There was little variation in the sound intensity of an individual's calls, but there was much variation of call intensity between males. Sound intensity did not correlate with body size or with ambient temperature. The playback of advertisement calls to territorial males showed three distinct behavioural thresholds that were evoked by particular sound intensities. The responses and thresholds were: 1) antiphonal calling at 76 {dB}; 2) encounter (territorial) calls at 84 {dB}; and 3) fight or flight at 91 {dB}. These thresholds are represented in a graphical model of male spacing. Encounter calls evoked the same behavioural responses but at much lower sound intensities (58, 67 and 68 {dB} respectively). The minimum territory depended on behavioural threshold (2), and in a homogeneous habitat was roughly circular with a radius equivalent to 84 {dB}. The area of the territory depended on the intensity of the resident's calls and on the density of vegetation at the calling site. For example, the minimum territory of a male in dense vegetation had a radius of 0.38 m while a male calling in the open had a territory radius of 0.72 m. The shape of the territory was influenced by the distribution of vegetation at the calling site. A nearest-neighbour analysis of a chorus of calling males yielded a mean territory radius of 0.68 m in vegetation and 1.28 m in the open. Zusammenfassung Männchen des Frosches Uperoleia rugosa rufen besonders nachts aus Ansammlungen, in denen sie gleichmäßig verteilt sind. Die Laute werden nach alien Seiten gleichmäßig abgestrahlt. Die Lautstärke nimmt mit dem Quadrat der Entfernung ab; Dämpfung durch Absorption und Reflektion an der Vegetation kommt hinzu. Die Lautstärke war beim einzelnen Tier recht konstant, schwankte aber stark zwischen den Männchen, unabhängig von Körpergröße oder Umgebungstemperatur. Das Vorspielen der Anzeigerufe ergab bei Reviermännchen drei, bestimmten Schallintensitätsschwellen zugeordnete Verhaltensweisen: 1. Anzeigerufe als Antwortrufe bei 76 {dB}; 2. Revierrufe bei 84 {dB}; 3. Kampf oder Rückzug bei 91 {dB}. Revierrufe bewirkten dieselben Verhaltensreaktionen bei viel geringeren Schallintensitäten (58, 67 bzw. 68 {dB}). Das kleinste Ausmaß eines Reviers hing von dem 2. Verhaltensschwellenwert ab. In einem homogenen Habitat war es etwa kreisrund mit einem 84 {dB} entsprechenden Radius. Die Reviergröße hing von der Intensität des Rufs seines Besitzers ab und von der Dichte der Vegetation an der Rufstelle. Das Mindestrevier eines Männchens hatte in dichter Vegetation einen Radius von 0,38 m, in offenem Gelände von 0,72 m. Die Gestalt des Reviers hing von der Vegetation an der Rufstelle ab. Die Analyse der Verteilung der nächsten Nachbarn in einem Chor rufender Männchen ergab einen Revierradius von 0,68 m in der Vegetation und von 1,28 m im offenen Gelände.},

	abstract = {During the spawning period, male grass frogs (Rana temporaria L.) frequently produce short and long territorial calls in addition to mating calls. The calls differ in mean pulse number, duration, and pattern of amplitude modu- lation. Experiments in which recorded natural calls are played back reveal that male grass frogs are capable of discriminating the different conspecific calls. A male frog stimulated by mating calls always responds by producing mating calls in greater numbers (Fig. 3). Territorial calls presented at low intensity also cause an increase in the mating-call rate (Fig. 4), but at high intensity they elicit territorial calls and turning toward the loud- speaker. A combination of short and long territori- al calls was especially effective in eliciting the phonotaxis response. As play-back experiments with simulated calls show, the carrier frequency and the pulse repetition rate are particularly im- portant cues for recognition of conspecific calls (Fig. 5). A simulated call with a 400-Hz carrier frequency (the dominant frequency of the mating call) is just as effective as the natural call with the complete frequency spectrum (Fig. 3), whereas a 1100-Hz simulated call is ineffective (Fig. 5). The chief factors in discrimination among the conspe- cific calls are the call repetition rate and probably the amplitude and frequency modulation. Changes in the duration of the calls had little effect (Fig. 6). The available evidence suggests that the mating call has a reciprocally stimulating action on males in a chorus, whereas the territorial calls express aggressiveness and give warning to other males.},

Substitution of the natural upward sweep by either a pure tone within the species frequency range or a reverse sweep did not alter the males' phonotactic behavior. Playbacks with artificial advertisement calls embedded in high levels of either low-pass or high-pass masking noise designed to saturate nerve fibers from either the amphibian papilla or basilar papilla showed that male phonotactic behavior in this species is subserved by activation of the basilar papilla of the inner ear.},

In contrast to earlier research, which has taken a largely static view of the world, new insights highlight how fluctuations in ecological and social environments, as well as non-equilibrium dynamics intrinsic to coevolutionary systems, can maintain both multiple redundant and non-redundant signals. Future challenges will include identifying the circumstances under which environmental fluctuations lead to multiple signalling, and the consequences of such fluctuations for speciation in multiple-signalling species. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Abstract Calling behaviour and the characteristics of the males' call are important for mate attraction, female mate choice and male mating success in anurans. In this study I investigated the variation in calling activity and the variation in one spectral (dominant frequency) and four temporal properties (call rate, call duration, duty cycle and pulse rate) of the advertisement call of strawberry poison frogs, Dendrobates pumilio, in two Costa Rican populations during two study periods. Regarding all call properties, no differences were found between populations or years, but between-male variation was significantly higher than within-recording and within-male variation. Dominant frequency was less variable within and among males than temporal call properties and I classified the former as static and the latter as intermediate properties of the call. No call property seemed to be strongly affected by body length or weight. Moreover, I used behavioural observations to relate male calling behaviour to mating success. Calling activity was more variable between males and accounted for more variability in mating success in multiple regression models than any call property. Some call properties (call rate, dominant frequency and pulse rate) were also related to male mating success in one or two study periods. These call properties are probably important for females during courtship to assess their prospective mate and/or for competitive male–male interactions. Furthermore, I compared call properties and mating success of some males for which data were available for both study periods. Pulse rate was lower in the second than in the first year, suggesting age-related changes in this call property. Moreover, male D. pumilio increased their relative mating success from the first to the second study year. Together with other studies, the data of this study suggest that, in anurans, endurance rivalry contributes more to variation in male mating success than does female choice based on male characteristics.},

Calls degraded less when broadcast higher above the ground compared to on the ground, and less in open habitat compared to forested habitat; there was an additional interaction between height and environment. Furthermore, calls with low dominant frequencies experienced less degradation than calls with high dominant frequencies.

	abstract = {Ambient ultraviolet-B radiation can harm amphibian eggs, larvae and adults. However, some amphibians avoid {UV}-B radiation when given the opportunity. The strawberry poison dart frog, Oophaga pumilio, is diurnal and males vocalize throughout the day in light gaps under forest canopies that expose them to solar radiation. Previous studies have demonstrated that males calling from high perches are more successful at mating than those at lower perches. We investigated whether frogs at higher perches receive more ultraviolet-B than those calling from lower perches. We also investigated whether frogs on perches receiving relatively low ultraviolet-B levels maintained their positions for longer compared to individuals calling from perches receiving higher levels of ultraviolet-B. Finally, since it has been hypothesized that some animals utilize levels of {UV}-A as a visual cue to avoid {UV}-B damage, we artificially elevated ultraviolet-A levels to examine whether males exposed to artificially elevated ultraviolet-A abandoned their perches sooner compared to males exposed to visible light. We found that frogs called from perches receiving low ultraviolet-B regardless of perch height, and that frogs maintain their positions longer on perches receiving low ultraviolet-B compared to perches receiving even slightly higher ultraviolet-B levels. Exposing the frogs to artificially elevated levels of ultraviolet-A radiation caused males to move off of their perches faster than when they were exposed to a control light source. These experiments suggest that ultraviolet radiation plays an important role in frog behavior related to perch selection, even in rainforests where much of the solar radiation is shielded by the forest canopy.},

	abstract = {Multimodal signals convey information that can be detected by receivers using two or more sensory modalities. The information transmitted through secondary channels may be mostly useless, redundant, complementary, or essential. Although each option implies different evolutionary scenarios, the relative role of signal subcomponents in a secondary channel has rarely been tested. Anuran amphibians are known for their extensive use of auditory signals, but growing evidence suggests their common use of multimodal signals where the visual component represents the secondary channel. Territorial males of the nontoxic frog Allobates femoralis use bimodal (acoustic + visual) signals to recognize conspecific intruders. We used playback experiments to test the relative importance of three visual subcomponents (body coloration, body size and body movement) in a multimodal signal to elicit agonistic reactions in males. The probability of attack was highly related to the movement and size of a dummy frog but very poorly related to dummy's coloration. The results suggest that any body movement, and not only vocal sac movement, is a nonredundant component of a bimodal signal that probably modulates male aggression. Against our expectations, males readily attacked dummy frogs painted to mimic the co-occurring frog Ameerega trivittata as well as models lacking some of their own pattern's subcomponents (white lines and yellow patches). Colourful frogs did not use body coloration as a visual cue for conspecific recognition. Both patterns recall the importance of carefully manipulating the availability of visual information in interpreting the origin and evolution of multimodal signals. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This phenomenon was studied in males of the dart-poison frog Epipedobates femoralis. These animals physically and vigorously defend their territories against conspecific calling intruders. In prior field studies with an electromechanical model frog, we were able to experimentally evoke this aggressive behavior only when an auditory cue (advertisement call) was presented simultaneously with a visual cue (vocal-sac pulsations). In the present field experiments, we used a modified version of the electromechanical model frog to present territorial males with visual and auditory cues separated by experimentally introduced temporal delays or spatial disparities to probe temporal and spatial integration in this animal. In temporal integration experiments, bimodal stimuli with temporal overlap during calling bouts consistently evoked aggressive behavior; stimuli lacking bimodal temporal overlap were relatively ineffective at the same task. In spatial integration studies, despite presenting the components of the bimodal stimulus with an initial spatial disparity of up to 12 cm, fighting behavior persisted. These results demonstrate that temporal and spatial integration may be reliably estimated in a freely behaving animal in its natural habitat and that we can use aggressive behavior in this species as an index of cross-modal integration in the field.},

	abstract = {In the evolution of species recognition mechanisms, the differential reactions of receivers towards a signal may be as important as variation in the signal features. In many animals, the auditory system's most sensitive range often matches the dominant frequency range of the signals. The degree of spectral matching, however, can be modified by stimulus intensity and, therefore, patterns detected in the laboratory should ideally be confirmed by field experiments. Territorial males of the dart-poison frog, Epipedobates femoralis, approach vocally active conspecific intruders. Since phonotaxis (followed by fighting) affects male fitness, the auditory system is predicted to discriminate against heterospecific calls. We tested the rôle of spectral and temporal call features in call discrimination by conducting playback experiments in the field with synthetic calls. To study the effect of heterospecific interference on the male's phonotactic reaction, we measured signal parameters and signalling activity of four sympatric species. The highest probability of response coincided with the spectral and temporal features of the population's advertisement call and the probability of approach was matched to the average frequency of this call. In addition, the degree of matching was sensitive to the number of notes per call. The decrease in the probability of response, however, was steeper at lower than average frequencies, where the probability of heterospecific interference was highest. Our results suggest that under field conditions frequency tuning interacts with temporal call features in maximizing the detection of conspecific signals and reducing the probability of heterospecific interference. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The efficacy of mimicry is thought to be affected by variation in the unpalatability of prey, the conspicuousness of the signals, and the visual system of predators that see them. Many frog species exhibit small colorful patches contrasting against an otherwise dark body. By measuring toxicity and color reflectance in a geographically variable frog species and the syntopic toxic species, we tested whether unpalatability was correlated with between-species color resemblance and whether resemblance was highest for the most conspicuous components of coloration pattern. Heterospecific resemblance in colorful patches was highest between species at the same locality, but unrelated to concomitant variation in toxicity. Surprisingly, resemblance was lower for the conspicuous femoral patches compared to the inconspicuous dorsum. By building visual models, we further tested whether resemblance was affected by the visual system of model predators. As predicted, mimic-model resemblance was higher under the visual system of simulated predators compared to no visual system at all. Our results indicate that femoral patches are aposematic signals and support a role of mimicry in driving phenotypic divergence or mimetic radiation between localities.},

However, such experiments investigate only one side of the interaction between resident and arriving males. We examined the effect of the amplitude of resident calls on the spacing of arriving male barking treefrogs, Hyla gratiosa, by placing two speakers, one playing advertisement calls 6 {dB} more intense than the other, at the chorus site and beginning playback before males arrived at the chorus. Distances between the speaker and the nearest male were greater for the speaker broadcasting calls at the higher amplitude, but this effect occurred only in low-density choruses. These results, combined with theoretical considerations, raise the possibility that the immediate benefit to males of producing high-amplitude signals may differ at different chorus densities. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

These categories are subdivided according to the social context of emission mostly reflecting also acoustic differences among call types. Some call types are here proposed to be synonymies of the mostly used and inclusive terms. We also suggest terminologies for basic bioacoustical analyses, mostly applied in call descriptions. Furthermore, we present cases of complex calls, including call gradation. Finally, based on novel data (such as an unusual case of juvenile vocalizations), we discuss situations in which it is difficult to classify call types, reflecting the need of experimental studies.},

Males defended territories with advertisement calls and, ultimately, fighting. Territory size ranged from 0.25 to 26 m2 and was positively correlated with duration of residence and calling activity of the owner. Females were not territorial and were never attacked when approaching calling males. Males and females only mated once and females sampled calling males before mating. Male mating success was closely correlated with territory size and calling activity. No correlation was found between male body size and mating success. Territories provide residents with sufficient space for mate attraction and reproduction without interference from rivals. Since territory size is dependent on calling activity which involves high energetic costs, it is suggested that territory size reveals male quality.},

	abstract = {Many species use acoustic signals to attract mates, and such signals can be degraded by anthropogenic noise. Anuran abundance has been shown to be negatively correlated with road traffic which could be due in part to the interruption of mate attraction by traffic noise. However, this impact could be small if anurans can alter their vocalization characteristics to avoid masking of their calls by traffic noise. We predicted that: (i) anuran vocalization characteristics (dominant frequency, mean amplitude and call rate) should be different in areas with different traffic noise levels; (ii) increases in traffic noise can cause immediate changes in amphibian vocalization characteristics; (iii) these altered vocalizations are similar to those at high traffic sites. To test the first prediction we compared vocalizations of four species of anuran at breeding sites in locations with low traffic noise vs. sites with high traffic noise. For the second prediction we broadcast traffic noise at low traffic (quiet) sites, and compared the anuran vocalizations before vs. during the broadcast traffic noise. For the third prediction we compared vocalizations at high traffic sites to those produced at low traffic sites while broadcasting traffic noise. Three species of anurans found at locations with low traffic noise produced vocalizations with different characteristics than individuals of the same species found in locations with high traffic noise. Broadcast traffic noise immediately altered amphibian vocalization characteristics such that they became similar to those of the same species found in locations with high traffic noise. We conclude that plasticity in the vocalizations of anurans allows for the maintenance of acoustic communication in the presence of traffic noise. © 2010 Elsevier Masson {SAS}.},

	abstract = {Many animal communication systems have evolved signal flexibility depending on environmental conditions. A common strategy of vocal communication is to increase amplitude in response to increasing noise levels. This phenomenon, known as the Lombard effect, is a widespread trait among mammals and birds. Anurans are a major group with many species that rely heavily on acoustic signals for sexual communication. Although these species often communicate in noisy environments, the presence of the Lombard effect in frogs remains unclear. We exposed male túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) to different noises with and without playback of conspecific calls. Males increased call amplitude, call rate, and call complexity in response to low-frequency noise (overlapping the species' call range) but not to high-frequency (nonoverlapping) noise. Vocal amplitude increased linearly with noise level demonstrating that túngara frogs exhibit the Lombard effect, and we discuss why different frog species may differ in their control over vocal amplitudes. Furthermore, we found the overall effect of noise to be similar to the effect of conspecific call playback. We speculate that vocal amplitude control may have evolved primarily as a response to increased competition at the cocktail party, similar to the way humans raise their voice when in a heated debate, and subsequently as a strategy to deal with background noise more generally},

	abstract = {Animals using sound communication have developed different strategies to overcome noise interference, but studies have rarely examined animals behaving in their natural environments. Males of the leptodactylid frog Eupsophus calcaratus exposed to natural noises of wind, rain, creek and sea surf and to a band-pass noise encompassing the main spectral components of the conspecific advertisement call increased their call rate in the presence of noises of moderate level, and this effect was particularly strong for the band-pass noise. Frogs exposed to band-pass noise of different intensities increased their call rate in response to exposures of 66-78 {dB} {RMS} sound pressure level. Call duration followed similar trends, but the effects of noise exposure on this measure of evoked vocal response were not as strong as those on call rate. The vocal responsiveness of males of this species in the presence of noise denotes adaptations to cope with high interference, in spite of the relatively simple acoustic environment of the austral temperate forest. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

	abstract = {{AbstractAntipredator} defenses and warning signals typically evolve in concert. However, the extensive variation across taxa in both these components of predator deterrence and the relationship between them are poorly understood. Here we test whether there is a predictive relationship between visual conspicuousness and toxicity levels across 10 populations of the color-polymorphic strawberry poison frog, Dendrobates pumilio. Using a mouse-based toxicity assay, we find extreme variation in toxicity between frog populations. This variation is significantly positively correlated with frog coloration brightness, a viewer-independent measure of visual conspicuousness (i.e., total reflectance flux). We also examine conspicuousness from the view of three potential predator taxa, as well as conspecific frogs, using taxon-specific visual detection models and three natural background substrates. We find very strong positive relationships between frog toxicity and conspicuousness for bird-specific perceptual models. Weaker but still positive correlations are found for crab and D. pumilio conspecific visual perception, while frog coloration as viewed by snakes is not related to toxicity. These results suggest that poison frog colors can be honest signals of prey unpalatability to predators and that birds in particular may exert selection on aposematic signal design.},

Jump angles of consecutive jumps and the straightness of paths were measured to quantify the accuracy of approach. The effect of interbout intervals on phonotactic approach was examined by comparing movement parameters of two tests, using a standard call with interbout intervals, and a continuous call without interbout intervals. Phonotactic approach occurred almost exclusively during calling bouts. Interbout intervals interrupted movement and did not alter the accuracy of approach. Our results suggest that only the calling bouts, but not the silent interbout intervals, play a crucial role for male phonotaxis in this species. Furthermore, anuran phonotactic approach is not strictly axis-alternated and, thus, not appropriately described by the generally used term ‘zig-zagging’.},

	abstract = {Unrelated species often evolve similar phenotypic solutions to the same environmental problem, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. But how do these ‘common traits’ arise? We address this question from a physiological perspective by assessing how convergence of an elaborate gestural display in frogs (“foot flagging”) is linked to changes in the androgenic hormone systems that underlie it. We show that the emergence of this rare display in unrelated anuran taxa is marked by a robust increase in the expression of androgen receptor ({AR}) {mRNA} in the musculature that actuates leg and foot movements, but we find no evidence of changes in abundance of {AR} expression in these frogs’ central nervous system ({CNS}). Meanwhile, the magnitude of the evolutionary change in muscular {AR} and its association with the origin of foot flagging differ among clades, suggesting that these variables evolve together in a mosaic fashion. Finally, while gestural displays do differ between species, variation in the complexity of a foot-flag routine does not predict differences in muscular {AR}. Altogether, these findings suggest that androgen-muscle interactions provide a conduit for convergence in sexual display behavior, potentially providing a ‘path of least resistance’ for the evolution of motor performance.},

	abstract = {D-Aspartic acid is an endogenous amino acid occurring in the endocrine glands as well as in the nervous system of various animal phyla. Our previous studies have provided evidence that D-aspartate plays a role in the induction of estradiol synthesis in gonads. Recently, we have also demonstrated that D-aspartic acid induces P450 aromatase {mRNA} expression in the frog (Pelophylax esculentus) testis. P450 aromatase is the key enzyme in the estrogen synthetic pathway and irreversibly converts testosterone into 17-estradiol. In this study, we firstly investigated the immunolocalisation of P450 aromatase in the brain of P. esculentus, which has never previously been described in amphibians. Therefore, to test the hypothesis that D-aspartate mediates a local synthesis of P450 aromatase in the frog brain, we administered D-aspartate in vivo to male frogs and then assessed brain aromatase expression, sex hormone levels and sex hormone receptor expression. We found that D-aspartate enhances brain aromatase expression ({mRNA} and protein) through the {CREB} pathway. Then, P450 aromatase induces 17-estradiol production from testosterone, with a consequent increase of its receptor. Therefore, the regulation of D-aspartate-mediated P450 aromatase expression could be an important step in the control of neuroendocrine regulation of the reproductive axis. Accordingly, we found that the sites of P450 aromatase immunoreactivity in the frog brain correspond to the areas known to be involved in neurosteroid synthesis.},

Immunoreactivity was weaker in zebra finches, and no signal could therefore be detected in the ventromedial and tuberal hypothalamus. The positive material was localized in the perikarya and in adjacent cytoplasmicprocesses, includingthe full length of axons always leaving a clear unstained cell nucleus. These features could be observed in more detail on sections cut from perfused brains and stained with an alkaline phosphatase procedure. The distribution of aromatase immunoreactivity was similar in the three species although minor differences were observed in the preoptic area. The localization of labelled neurons coincidedwith the distribution of aromatase activity as studied by in vitro radioenzyme assays on brain nuclei dissected by the Palkovits punch method. There was one striking exception to this rule: no immunoreactivity was detected in the zebra finch telencephalon,while assays had shown the presence of an active enzyme in several nuclei such as the robustus archistriatalis, the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale, and the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis. The origins of this discrepancy and the functional role of the aromatase observed in the axons are discussed.},

In the male Syrian hamster, these signals are integrated in nuclei of the medial extended amygdala, where olfactory and vomeronasal system transmission is modulated by populations of androgen- and estrogen-sensitive neurons. Evidence from behavioral changes following lesions and from immediate early gene expression supports the hypothesis that the medial extended amygdala and medial preoptic area belong to a circuit that functions selectively in male sexual behavior. However, accumulated behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neuroendocrine data in hamsters, other rodents, and other mammals indicate that this circuit is embedded in a larger integrated network that controls not only male mating behavior, but female sexual behavior, parental behavior, and various forms of aggression. In this context, perhaps an individual animal’s social responses can be more easily understood as a repertoire of closely interrelated, hormone-regulated behaviors, shaped by development and experience and modulated acutely by the environmental signals and the hormonal milieu of the brain.},

The nodes of this network are reciprocally connected, contain receptors for sex steroid hormones, and are involved in multiple forms of social behavior. Other hodological features and neuropeptide distributions are likewise very similar across taxa. This evolutionary conservation represents a boon for experiments on phenotypic behavioral variation, as the extraordinary social diversity of teleost fish and songbirds can now be used to generate broadly relevant insights into issues of brain function that are not particularly tractable in other vertebrate groups. Two such lines of research are presented here, each of which addresses functional variation within the network as it relates to divergent patterns of social behavior. In the first set of experiments, we have used a sexually polymorphic fish to demonstrate that natural selection can operate independently on hypothalamic neuroendocrine functions that are relevant for (1) gonadal regulation and (2) sex-typical behavioral modulation. In the second set of experiments, we have exploited the diversity of avian social organizations and ecologies to isolate species-typical group size as a quasiindependent variable. These experiments have shown that specific areas and peptidergic components of the social behavior network possess functional properties that evolve in parallel with divergence and convergence in sociality.},

            Many organisms have evolved adaptations to increase the odds of survival of their offspring. Parental care has evolved several times in animals including ectotherms. In amphibians, {\textasciitilde} 10\% of species exhibit parental care. Among these, poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are well-known for their extensive care, which includes egg guarding, larval transport, and specialized tadpole provisioning with trophic eggs. At least one third of dendrobatids displaying aposematism by exhibiting warning coloration that informs potential predators about the presence of defensive skin toxins. Aposematism has a central role in poison frog diversification, including diet specialization, and visual and acoustic communication; and it is thought to have impacted their reproductive biology as well. We tested the latter association using multivariate phylogenetic methods at the family level. Our results show complex relationships between aposematism and certain aspects of the reproductive biology in dendrobatids. In particular, aposematic species tend to use more specialized tadpole-deposition sites, such as phytotelmata, and ferry fewer tadpoles than non-aposematic species. We propose that aposematism may have facilitated the diversification of microhabitat use in dendrobatids in the context of reproduction. Furthermore, the use of resource-limited tadpole-deposition environments may have evolved in tandem with an optimal reproductive strategy characterized by few offspring, biparental care, and female provisioning of food in the form of unfertilized eggs. We also found that in phytotelm-breeders, the rate of transition from cryptic to aposematic phenotype is 17 to 19 times higher than vice versa. Therefore, we infer that the aposematism in dendrobatids might serve as an umbrella trait for the evolution and maintenance of their complex offspring-caring activities.},

Poison frogs are a well-studied group of small Neotropical frogs with diverse parental behaviors, distinct calls, and bright colors that warn predators about their toxicity; and a showcase of advances in fundamental biology through natural history observations. The dyeing poison frog, Dendrobates tinctorius, is emblematic of the Guianas region, widespread in the pet trade, and increasingly popular in research. This species shows several unusual behaviors, such as the lack of advertisement calls and the aggregation around tree-fall gaps, which remain poorly described and understood. Here, we summarize our observations from a natural population of D. tinctorius in French Guiana collected over various ﬁeld trips between 2009 and 2017; our aim is to provide groundwork for future fundamental and applied research spanning parental care, animal dispersal, disease spread, habitat use in relation to color patterns, and intra-speciﬁc communication, to name a few. We report sex differences in habitat use and the striking invasion of tree-fall gaps; describe their courtship and aggressive behaviors; document egg development and tadpole transport; and discuss how the knowledge generated by this study could set the grounds for further research on the behavior, ecology, and conservation of this species.},

We used miniature radiotransmitters to track the movements of two poison frog species during tadpole transport, and surveyed pool availability in the study area. We found that parental males move farther than expected by the distance to the nearest pool and spread their offspring across multiple pools.

	abstract = {The information content of signals remains one of the central questions in animal communication. Auditory signals might contain information that allows receivers to estimate the distance as well as the size or the motivational state of senders. Proper differential reactions by receivers could be especially important for terri­ torial species and lead to behavioural adjustments towards intruders according to the threat level: the perceived risk of losing territory. Therefore, territorial individuals should decode signal parameters that indicate the sender’s size, distance, and motivation/treat level, reacting accordingly. To test this hypothesis, we studied the phonotactic reaction in territorial males of the poison frog Oophaga histrionica, after analyzing the variability of spectral and temporal parameters of natural calls. Next, we constructed synthetic calls by manipulating sound amplitude (sound pressure level: {SPL}), gross (inter-call intervals), and fine-temporal (number of pulses) structure of synthetic signals. In this way, we simulated near and far intruders with potentially variable sizes, motivational states, or threat levels. Then, we conducted playback experiments using these synthetic calls to determine 1) how perceived proximity of vocal competitors (determined by {SPL}) affect the behavior of receivers, and 2) how variation in the temporal structure of calls (inter-call interval and call pulse number) impact the behavior of receivers. We also asked whether signals convey body-size related information by analyzing the relationship between call parameters and body size of the males receiving the experimental stimuli. Consistent with our hypothesis, males recognized the variations in the {SPL} of calls. Males attacking the simulated opponent increased the number of pulses per call, while those retreating, kept pulse number unchanged (a graded aggressive signal). On the other hand, despite call traits resulted as poor predictors of body size, both {SPL} and fine temporal call traits might aid to predict whether a contestant will attack an opponent. Our data demonstrate that males discriminate and use {SPL} to estimate the sender’s distance and use the call’s fine temporal traits and to adjust the competitive/aggressive reaction using bimodal signals. They further suggest that body size assessment is not always an important factor in vocally- mediated agonistic interactions.},

	abstract = {In territorial species, males use signals to advertise territory ownership to other males. In species with acoustic communication, masking interference by heterospeciﬁc signals may impede male–male communication and affect the reproductive success of males. Frogs are thought to minimize masking interference by using species-speciﬁc frequency channels for communication. For this strategy to work, a frequency match is expected between the advertisement call and the auditory sensitivity. A previous ﬁeld study on the Amazonian frog Epipedobates femoralis supported this prediction, but also revealed an asymmetric decrease in the probability of male reaction towards synthetic calls. That males of E. femoralis reacted less towards low-frequency (compared with highfrequency) calls was interpreted as a mechanism that reduces masking interference by E. trivittatus, a species calling within a lower, partially overlapping, frequency range. If this hypothesis holds, then males of E. trivittatus should exhibit the opposite asymmetry pattern, i.e. react less towards high-frequency (compared with low-frequency) calls. We tested this prediction by conducting 25 playback experiments on 22 males of E. trivittatus. Male phonotactic reaction towards synthetic calls of various frequency values was evaluated as a binary variable (the male either approached or not the loudspeaker), by measuring the latency until ﬁrst jump, and by calculating the linear approaching speed. As in E. femoralis, the maximum probability of positive reaction was matched to the call frequency. Against our expectations, the response curve was symmetric. We discuss whether these results reﬂect a lack of selective pressures, or a compromise between natural selection and physiological constraints on the shape of the frequency recognition curves.},

	abstract = {Species conservation with fragmented and endangered populations must be based on a prior and thorough knowledge of the structure and population dynamics. Oophaga lehmanni is a dendrobatid species endemic of Colombia and is restricted to its type locality. This species has a fragmented distribution and is considered as critically endangered mainly due to habitat destruction and overexploitation. Oophaga lehmanni exhibits phenotypic variation in the dorsal color pattern (red and yellow morphs). We reconstructed the overexploitation history that this species has faced in the last 40 years. In addition, we collected genetic and morphological data for the first time in natural populations to describe genetic diversity between and within populations, and to evaluate morphological and genetic differences between red and yellow morphs. Overexploitation data suggest that more than 80.000 (Min = 60.047–Max = 102.236) frogs were extracted from the field in the last four decades, probably generating the local extirpation or population decline from the type locality. Genetic data showed reduced genetic diversity. Observed heterozygosity (mean ± s.d. = 0.599 ± 0.165) is lower than expected (mean ± s.d. = 0.867 ± 0.082). We did not find differences in body size and heterozygosity between the two morphs; however, individuals analyzed were assigned to two genetic clusters, which corresponded to the O. lehmanni-yellow and O. lehmanni-red. In addition, F­ {ST} (0.209) and Nei genetic distance (0.18) values indicated genetic differentiation between the two morphs; therefore, red and yellow morphs should be treated as independent management units. This information will help to define appropriate and long-term conservation units, as a useful tool to mitigate the extinction risk of this species.},

	abstract = {Variation in natural behavior is tightly linked to the ecological resources with which they co-evolved. This review discusses poison frog behavior and neuroendocrinology to illustrate how ecological factors drive diversification of behavior and its underlying neural mechanisms. Poison frogs show tremendous diversity in reproductive strategies that are tightly linked to water resources in their environment. Different species utilize particular pool sizes to rear their offspring, which has selected for sex differences in parental behavior among poison frog species. Tadpole behavior reflects the behavioral diversity of adults, where tadpoles can display social group living or violent ag­ gression and begging behavior, which are all associated with pool size and occupancy. Using this behavioral diversity among poison frog species, we have identified core brain regions, like the hippocampus and preoptic area, as being involved in regulating different aspects of amphibian parental behavior. In contrast to core brain regions, the neu­ romodulators governing these behaviors seem to be more labile across species. This work exemplifies how com­ parative studies are a prime experimental system to study how evolution tunes neural circuits that give rise to the diversity of behaviors we observe in the natural world. Finally, this review ends on a more important form of diversity – that of our scientific community – and how community outreach, decolonization of field based science, and inclusion of groups historically excluded from conducting research are needed for the scientific enterprise to transform into something truly beneficial for all members of our society.},

	abstract = {Background: The consumption of conspecific young by adult individuals is a common phenomenon across various animal taxa. Possible adaptive benefits of such behaviour include the acquisition of nutrients, decreased competition for one’s own offspring, and/or increased mating opportunities. Clutch cannibalism has occasionally been observed in several species of Neotropical poison frogs, but the circumstances under which this behaviour occurs has rarely been investigated experimentally. Recent experiments with the poison frog Allobates femoralis have shown that males indiscriminately transport all clutches located inside their own territory to bodies of water, but become highly cannibalistic when taking over a new territory. Females are able to indirectly discriminate between their own and foreign clutches by location and take over transport duties of their own clutches only in the absence of the father. Cannibalism by A. femoralis females has not been previously observed. We thus asked if, and under which circumstances, cannibalism of unrelated clutches by female A. femoralis would occur, by manipulating the presence of the clutch’s father, the female’s own reproductive state, and the female’s familiarity with the environment.
Results: Females clearly cannibalize foreign clutches. Cannibalism was most pronounced when the female had not recently produced her own clutch and the father of the foreign clutch was absent. The female’s familiarity with the area had no significant influence on the likelihood of cannibalism to occur.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that both previous oviposition and the father’s presence reduce cannibalistic behaviour in A. femoralis females. Cannibalistic females may gain nutritional benefits or enhanced inclusive fitness by preying on other females’ offspring. The finding that the father’s presence at the clutch site/territory was sufficient to reduce cannibalism by females suggests a prominent role of male territoriality for the evolution of male parental care.},

	abstract = {The adaptive significance of sequential polyandry is a challenging question in evolutionary and behavioral biology. Costs and benefits of different mating patterns are shaped by the spatial distribution of individuals and by genetic parameters such as the pairwise relatedness between potential mating partners. Thus, females should become less choosy as costs of mating and searching for mates increase. We used parentage assignments to investigate spatial and genetic patterns of mating across a natural population of the Neotropical frog Allobates femoralis, a species characterized by male territoriality and care and female iteroparity. There was no correlation between genetic and spatial distances between adult individuals across the population. In 72\% of cases, females mated with males available within a radius of 20 m. Mean pairwise relatedness coefficients of successful reproducers did not differ from random mating but had a lower variance than expected by chance, suggesting maximal reproductive output at intermediate genetic divergence. We also found evidence for selection in favor of more heterozygous individuals between the embryo and adult stage. The level of sequential polyandry significantly increased with the number of spatially available males. Females that had more candidate males also produced more adult progeny. We hypothesize that the benefits associated with female multiple mating outweigh the costs of in- and outbreeding depression, and consequently precluded the evolution of ‘choosy’ mate selection in this species.},

	abstract = {Reproductive hormones can modulate communication-evoked behavior by acting on neural systems associated with motivation; however, recent evidence suggests that modulation occurs at the sensory processing level as well. The anuran auditory midbrain processes communication stimuli, and is sensitive to steroid hormones. Using multiunit electrophysiology, we tested whether sex and circulating testosterone inﬂuence auditory sensitivity to pure tones and to the natural vocalization in the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea. Sex did not inﬂuence audiogram best frequencies although sexes did differ in the sensitivities at those frequencies with males more sensitive in the lower frequency range. Females were more sensitive than males in response to the natural vocalization, despite showing no difference in response to pure tones at frequencies found within the advertisement call. Thresholds to frequencies outside the range of the male advertisement call were higher in females. Additionally, circulating testosterone increased neural thresholds in females in a frequency-speciﬁc manner. These results demonstrate that sex differences are limited to frequency ranges that relate to the processing of natural vocalizations, and depend on the type of stimulus. The frequency-dependent and stimulus-dependent nature of sex and testosterone inﬂuences suggests that reproductive hormones inﬂuence the ﬁltering properties of the auditory system.},

	abstract = {During the past several years, the noninvasive measurement of steroid metabolites from mammalian feces and bird droppings has become more and more popular. With an increasing acceptance of the method, investigators may become less aware of the need to validate their assays. It is shown why such validations are essential for each new species investigated and various ways to physiologically validate such noninvasive methods are described. Using the European stonechat (Saxicola torquata rubicola) as a model, it is explained why a validated method to measure androgen metabolites in males does not necessarily work in females. In addition the difficulties that may be neglected owing to the superficial ease of sampling and processing of excreta are investigated. Various issues that may arise during sampling, storage, and extraction of excreta are addressed. Finally, results suggesting that experimental manipulations of the diet may affect hormone metabolite levels in European stonechats are presented. So far, only a few studies have investigated the impact of diet on hormone metabolite levels, and these are the first data to report such an impact in birds. More studies are urgently needed to learn more about differences between the sexes, individuals, and populations and the impact of diet and energy metabolism on hormone metabolites.},

	abstract = {Although the involvement of peptide hormones in parental care behaviors is well investigated in vertebrates, in amphibians the physiological basis of parental care is largely unknown. This is all the more surprising as parental care behaviors in these tetrapods are remarkably diverse. The poison frog Ranitomeya imitator performs biparental care, including clutch guarding, tadpole transportation and nutrient provisioning. Here we tested whether the nonapeptides arginine-vasotocin ({AVT}) and mesotocin ({MT}) are involved in clutch guarding and tadpole transportation in these frogs. In ex-sito experiments we injected males and females after clutch deposition and before tadpole transport with {AVT} and {MT}, respectively, as well as their antagonist or a control. We measured two types of egg caring behavior (intense and general care) and compared the success rate of tadpole transportation after treatments. Surprisingly we found that {AVT} did not trigger, but decreased intense egg care behaviors in males and females. However, there was a trend for general care behavior to increase, which might explain the adverse effect regarding intense care. {MT} did not have an effect on egg caring behaviors, but after administration of this hormone males were less likely to transport their offspring later on. Our results indicate that {AVT} might be partly involved in egg caring behaviors in R. imitator, while {MT} does not appear to play any role in behaviors prior to tadpole transportation in males. This implies that other hormones, such as steroids or prolactin are likely to be important for early parental care behaviors in poison frogs.},

Males of prolonged breeders usually call from stationary positions to attract females and often maintain some sort of intermale spacing. Many aspects of vocal behaviour and chorus organization can be viewed as consequences of intrasexual competition . Males of some prolonged breeders defend allpurpose territories, oviposition sites, or courtship areas against conspecific males . Males with high quality territories may enhance their attractiveness to females and obtain several mates in one season . The social organization of some species resembles the lek behaviour of other vertebrates .

	abstract = {Global increases in environmental noise levels – arising from expansion of human populations, transportation networks, and resource extraction – have catalysed a recent surge of research into the effects of noise on wildlife. Synthesising a coherent understanding of the biological consequences of noise from this literature is challenging. Taxonomic groups vary in auditory capabilities. A wide range of noise sources and exposure levels occur, and many kinds of biological responses have been observed, ranging from individual behaviours to changes in ecological communities. Also, noise is one of several environmental effects generated by human activities, so researchers must contend with potentially confounding explanations for biological responses. Nonetheless, it is clear that noise presents diverse threats to species and ecosystems and salient patterns are emerging to help inform future natural resource-management decisions. We conducted a systematic and standardised review of the scientiﬁc literature published from 1990 to 2013 on the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife, including both terrestrial and aquatic studies. Research to date has concentrated predominantly on European and North American species that rely on vocal communication, with approximately two-thirds of the data set focussing on songbirds and marine mammals. The majority of studies documented effects from noise, including altered vocal behaviour to mitigate masking, reduced abundance in noisy habitats, changes in vigilance and foraging behaviour, and impacts on individual ﬁtness and the structure of ecological communities. This literature survey shows that terrestrial wildlife responses begin at noise levels of approximately 40 {dBA}, and 20\% of papers documented impacts below 50 {dBA}. Our analysis highlights the utility of existing scientiﬁc information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife for predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure and implementing meaningful mitigation measures. Future research directions that would support more comprehensive predictions regarding the magnitude and severity of noise impacts include: broadening taxonomic and geographical scope, exploring interacting stressors, conducting larger-scale studies, testing mitigation approaches, standardising reporting of acoustic metrics, and assessing the biological response to noise-source removal or mitigation. The broad volume of existing information concerning the effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife offers a valuable resource to assist scientists, industry, and natural-resource managers in predicting potential outcomes of noise exposure.},

	title = {Acoustics of the display of the sage grouse},
	abstract = {Summary We present evidence that the acoustic component of the strut display of male sage grouse Centrocercus urophasianus is highly directional and that the nature of this directionality is unique among measured vertebrates. Where vertebrate acoustic signals have been found to be directional, they are most intense anteriorly and are bilaterally symmetrical. Our results show that sage grouse acoustic radiation (beam) patterns are often asymmetric about the birds’ anterior–posterior axis. The beam pattern of the ‘whistle’ note is actually strikingly bilobate with a deep null directly in front of the displaying bird. While the sage grouse display serves to attract potential mates, male sage grouse rarely face females head on when they call. The results of this study suggest that males may reach females with a high-intensity signal despite their preference for an oblique display posture relative to those females. We characterized these patterns using a novel technique that allowed us to map acoustic radiation patterns of unrestrained animals calling in the wild. Using an eightmicrophone array, our technique integrates acoustic localization with synchronous pressure-ﬁeld measurements while controlling for small-scale environmental variation in sound propagation.},

Measurements were conducted of sound power and sound pressure level of representative utterances. Monkey vocal radiation patterns were also measured. The results showed that vocal amplitude ranged from 62 {dB} to 100 {dB} in sound pressure (re 1 pw). At a distance of 2m, the loudest calls approached an amplitude of 110 {dB} {SPL}, a level about equal to the loudest human yell. The measurements of call amplitude conducted here exceeded those derived from the field by approximately 10 {dB}. It was shown that the discrepancy in amplitude between these laboratory based measurements and earlier measurements conducted under field conditions (Waser and Waser 1977) was probably due to destructive interference between the direct wave and the "ground wave", a phase shifted wave reflected from the ground. Measurements of radiation patterns of primate vocalizations showed that, like human speech, directivity was a function of frequency, with high-frequency components being radiated more directionally than lowerfrequency components, However, primate utterances were in general radiated more omnidirectionally than was human speech.},

The sound was analysed in one-third-octave bands with centre frequencies from 3.15 {kHz} to 16 {kHz}, the frequency range of the calling song. The seven cicadas studied had very similar spatial radiation patterns, but somewhat dierent emitted sound powers (range 190±440 {nW}, mean 280 {nW}, at 22 °C). At low frequencies, the pattern of sound radiation was close to spherical. At higher frequencies, systematic deviations from a spherical pattern were evident. The deviations were of the order of magnitude expected for monopolar sound sources located on sound-shielding bodies. We conclude that, although the singing cicada produces a quite complex acoustic near ®eld, it behaves as a monopole in the far ®eld. These ®ndings are compared with data from a singing grasshopper of similar size, which in the far ®eld behaves as a multipole.},

	abstract = {In species with male parental care, polygyny may reduce the parental effort provided by a male, and hence impose a cost on the fitness of his mates, because of decreased growth, survival or health of offspring. I examined a cost of polygyny in the green dart-poison frog, Dendrobates auratus, a species with male parental care in which both male polygyny and mate guarding by females occurs (Summers 1989). All D. auratus males seen carrying tadpoles in a marked area were followed and the pools where they deposited their tadpoles were recorded. Males frequently deposited more than one tadpole in the same pool (in 25\% of the observed depositions a male deposited a tadpole in a pool where he had previously deposited at least one other tadpole). Experiments involving manipulation of tadpole densities in pools typically utilized by D. auratus (calabash husks and treeholes) showed that increasing tadpole number had a strong negative effect on both growth rate and survivorship, indicating that polygyny can impose a cost on the fitness of a male's offspring. Hence, females do face a potential cost, in terms of reduced offspring growth and survivorship, when their mates mate polygynously and care for the offspring of other females.},

This gender difference arises after hatching as a result of cell atrophy in the female and cell growth in the male. Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins. Estrogen loses its masculinizing effects completely after day 45 when the adult level of neuronal atrophy is reached. Thus, the end and the intensity of hormone action appear to be correlated with the timing of neuronal atrophy.},

	abstract = {Abstract
              The Ranging Hypothesis ({RH}) ({MORTON}, 1982) proposed a form of distance assessment (ranging) based upon perception of signal degradation using memorized signals as a yardstick to distance. The predictions of the {RH} include distance assessment mechanisms, {DAMs}; it is proposed that these have opened a new evolutionary process illustrated by the complicated songs and singing behaviour in the oscine passerines ("songbirds"). The {RH} identifies sources of selection favouring learning, multiple or single song types, song structural complexity not accounted for by species isolating mechanism ideas, and emphasizes the ecological basis for the evolution of long distance communication. New importance is given to the acoustic physical structure of songs. The {RH} encompasses and contrasts song evolution in warm climate regions with those in cold temperate climates. Three interrelated stages of long distance signal evolution are presented: detectability, threat, and disrupt. A singer/listener role dichotomy in selective pressures is described and the results discussed. Listeners developed distance assessment mechanisms ({DAMs}) resulting in an evolutionary arms race between listeners and singers. Singers developed methods to use {DAMs} to their best interest (threat and disrupt). Song learning in passerines developed in response to this arms race to enhance disruption, a situation most prevalent in cold temperate zone regions. The acoustic determinants of effective song distance are described and discussed in relation to the evolution of signal structures. Finally, the {RH} is discussed in relation to some previous hypotheses on song function and evolution.},

	abstract = {Inferring the role of interactions in territorial animals relies upon accurate recordings of the behaviour of neighbouring individuals. Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).},

Here we develop a null model that quantiﬁes the impact of regulatory behaviors (speciﬁcally, thermoregulatory behaviors) on body temperature and on performance of ectotherms. We apply the model to data on a lizard (Anolis cristatellus) and show that thermoregulatory behaviors likely inhibit selection for evolutionary shifts in thermal physiology with altitude. Because behavioral adjustments are commonly used by ectotherms to regulate physiological performance, regulatory behaviors should generally constrain rather than drive evolution, a phenomenon we call the “Bogert effect.” We brieﬂy review a few other examples that contradict the classical view of behavior as the inevitable driving force in evolution. Overall, our analysis and brief review challenge the classical view that behavior is invariably the driving force in evolution, and instead our work supports the alternative view that behavior has diverse—and sometimes conﬂicting—effects on the directions and rates at which other traits evolve.},

	abstract = {Longer-range movements of anuran amphibians such as mass migrations and habitat invasion have received a lot of attention, but fine-scale spatial behavior remains largely understudied. This gap is especially striking for species that show long-term site fidelity and display their whole behavioral repertoire in a small area. Studying finescale movement with conventional capture-mark-recapture techniques is difficult in inconspicuous amphibians: individuals are hard to find, repeated captures might affect their behavior and the number of data points is too low to allow a detailed interpretation of individual space use and time budgeting. In this study, we overcame these limitations by equipping females of the Brilliant-Thighed Poison Frog (Allobates femoralis) with a tag allowing frequent monitoring of their location and behavior. Neotropical poison frogs are well known for their complex behavior and diverse reproductive and parental care strategies. Although the ecology and behavior of the polygamous leaf-litter frog Allobates femoralis is well studied, little is known about the fine-scale space use of the non-territorial females who do not engage in acoustic and visual displays. We tracked 17 females for 6 to 17 days using a harmonic direction finder to provide the first precise analysis of female space use in this species. Females moved on average 1 m per hour and the fastest movement, over 20 m per hour, was related to a subsequent mating event. Traveled distances and activity patterns on days of courtship and mating differed considerably from days without reproduction. Frogs moved more on days with lower temperature and more precipitation, but mating seemed to be the main trigger for female movement. We observed 21 courtships of 12 tagged females. For seven females, we observed two consecutive mating events. Estimated home ranges after 14 days varied considerably between individuals and courtship and mating associated space use made up for ∼30\% of the home range. Allobates femoralis females spent large parts of their time in one to three small centers of use. Females did not adjust their time or space use to the density of males in their surroundings and did not show wide-ranging exploratory behavior. Our study demonstrates how tracking combined with detailed behavioral observations can reveal the patterns and drivers of fine-scale spatial behavior in sedentary species.},

	abstract = {Animals relying on uncertain, ephemeral and patchy resources have to regularly update their information about profitable sites. For many tropical amphibians, widespread, scattered breeding pools constitute such fluctuating resources. Among tropical amphibians, poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) exhibit some of the most complex spatial and parental behaviors—including territoriality and tadpole transport from terrestrial clutches to ephemeral aquatic deposition sites. Recent studies have revealed that poison frogs rely on spatial memory to successfully navigate through their environment. This raises the question of when and how these frogs gain information about the area and suitable reproductive resources. To investigate the spatial patterns of pool use and to reveal potential explorative behavior, we used telemetry to follow males of the territorial dendrobatid frog Allobates femoralis during tadpole transport and subsequent homing. To elicit exploration, we reduced resource availability experimentally by simulating desiccated deposition sites. We found that tadpole transport is strongly directed towards known deposition sites and that frogs take similar direct paths when returning to their home territory. Frogs move faster during tadpole transport than when homing after the deposition, which probably reflects different risks and costs during these two movement phases. We found no evidence for exploration, neither during transport nor homing, and independent of the availability of deposition sites. We suggest that prospecting during tadpole transport is too risky for the transported offspring as well as for the transporting male. Relying on spatial memory of multiple previously discovered pools appears to be the predominant and successful strategy for the exploitation of reproductive resources in A. femoralis. Our study provides for the first time a detailed description of poison frog movement patterns during tadpole transport and corroborates recent findings on the significance of spatial memory in poison frogs. When these frogs explore and discover new reproductive resources remains unknown.},

	abstract = {The conversion of natural habitats to human land uses often increases local temperatures, creating novel thermal environments for species. The variable responses of ectotherms to habitat conversion, where some species decline while others persist, can partly be explained by variation among species in their thermal niches. However, few studies have examined thermal niche variation within species and across forest‐land use ecotones, information that could provide clues about the capacity of species to adapt to changing temperatures. Here, we quantify individual‐level variation in thermal traits of the tropical poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in thermally contrasting habitats. Specifically, we examined local environmental temperatures, field body temperatures (Tb), preferred body temperatures (Tpref), critical thermal maxima ({CTmax}), and thermal safety margins ({TSM}) of individuals from warm, converted habitats and cool forests. We found that frogs from converted habitats exhibited greater mean Tb and Tpref than those from forests. In contrast, {CTmax} and {TSM} did not differ significantly between habitats. However, {CTmax} did increase moderately with increasing Tb, suggesting that changes in {CTmax} may be driven by microscale temperature exposure within habitats rather than by mean habitat conditions. Although O. pumilio exhibited moderate divergence in Tpref, {CTmax} appears to be less labile between habitats, possibly due to the ability of frogs in converted habitats to maintain their Tb below air temperatures that reach or exceed {CTmax}. Selective pressures on thermal tolerances may increase, however, with the loss of buffering microhabitats and increased frequency of extreme temperatures expected under future habitat degradation and climate warming.},

	abstract = {Abstract Amphibians are typically intolerant of high temperatures and dehydrating conditions, and small species are particularly susceptible to desiccation. The rockhole frog, Litoria meiriana (Hylidae), is diurnal and is often observed on rocks in the sun near streams in tropical Australia. These hot, desiccating conditions are avoided by most frog species. We measured the microclimate in the areas used by frogs and the activity, body temperatures and hydric state of free-ranging individuals of this small frog. We also used plaster models to further explore the dynamic nature of hydric state by combining estimates of water loss and water uptake with behavioural observations of activity and microhabitat selection. Both direct measures and estimates of dynamic hydric state indicated that free-ranging frogs generally maintained a hydric state above 95\% of full hydration, but occasionally, particularly during the afternoon, frogs allowed their hydric state to fall as low as 85\%. Body temperatures of frogs remained below the critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}) even when the frogs were in the sun, because this species has no cutaneous resistance to evaporative water loss and so they cool by evaporation. However, during the hotter part of the day, on dry sunny substrates, the hydric state of the frogs could fall to near lethal hydration states (approximately 70\% of full hydration) within a short period (approximately 20?min). Thus, the threat of desiccation appears to be more limiting than the threat of overheating. These diurnal frogs rely on frequent bouts of rehydration to support their ability to venture onto hot, dry rocks during the day.},

Learning about their thermal ecology is essential to infer sensitivity to environmental changes, particularly climate warming. We report on the activity temperature and thermoregulatory behavior of three high-elevation species of harlequin frogs, Atelopus nahumae, Atelopus laetissimus and Atelopus carrikeri. The ﬁrst two mentioned live in streams in Andean rain forests, whereas A. carrikeri inhabits paramo streams in the {SNSM}. We studied the thermal ecology of these species in tree localities differing in altitude, and focused on activity body, operative, substrate and air temperature. A main trend was lower body temperature as elevation increased, so that differences among species were largely explained by differences in substrate temperature. However, this temperature variation was much lower in forest species than paramo species. The Atelopus species included in this work proved to be thermoconformers, a trend that not extended to all congenerics at high elevation. This diversity in thermal ecology poses important questions when discussing the impact of climate warming for high-elevation harlequin frogs. For example, forest species show narrow thermal ranges and, if highly specialized, may be more susceptible to temperature change. Paramo species such as A. carrikeri, in contrast, may be more resilient to temperature change.},

	abstract = {We used simulations from a biophysical model that integrates interlinked exchanges of energy and water between frogs and their environments to address questions about the limits to thermoregulation and about adaptations for arboreality. Body size and cutaneous resistance (Rc) both signiﬁcantly affected body temperature (Tb) and the time to desiccate to 70\% of standard mass (an ecologically relevant metric of desiccation). Cutaneous resistances , 25 s/cm allow basking frogs to elevate their Tb several degrees above ambient, but Rc above 25 had little additional effect on Tb. Small frogs (,10 g) are able to elevate their Tb above ambient while basking, even with small Rc. Large frogs must have greater skin resistances to be able to elevate body temperatures above ambient, yet large frogs take longer to desiccate to 70\% of their standard mass. Frogs can avoid rapid desiccation with high Rc, a large body size, or some combination of these traits. Our literature survey indicates that frogs with a combination of Rc and body size that would result in long times to desiccate to 70\% of standard mass tend to be arboreal, suggesting that those species may be selectively favored in a niche that often requires frogs to be away from water sources for extended periods of time.},

I studied the microhabitat associations and thermal ecology of four anurans (Colostethus subpunctatus, Atelopus sp. nov., Eleutherodactylus bogotensis, and Hyla labialis) that live in the Andes of central Colombia. I compared two populations (3500 m and 2900 m) to evaluate the impact of a change in elevation on microhabitat thermal regimes and frog behavior. Ambient temperatures of frequently used microhabitats (soil surface, retreat sites, bogs, and ponds) were significantly lower at 3500 m. However, for each species the microhabitat associations and general patterns of activity were similar at both elevations. Body temperatures of active frogs were mainly determined by the interaction between microhabitat selection and time of the day, therefore frogs at 3500 m had lower activity temperatures than conspecifics at 2900 m. Terrestrial and diurnal anurans (Atelopus sp. nov.) experienced highly variable activity temperatures. Frogs associated with water bodies (C. subpunctatus, and H. labialis) experienced more moderate and less variable temperatures. Terrestrial, nocturnal frogs (E. bogotensis) exhibited the lowest activity temperatures, and their thermal ecology was strongly affected by increase in altitude. The physical nature of high tropical elevations limits the opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation in amphibians, and increases the importance of physiological adjustments to tolerate a wide thermal range. This may partially explain why only a small number of amphibian species, representing genera that are much more diverse at lower elevations, have been able to exploit these environments.},

	abstract = {Thermal and water balance are coupled in anurans, and species with particularly permeable skin avoid overheating more effectively than minimizing variance of body temperature. In turn, temperature affects muscle performance in several ways, so documenting the mean and variance of body temperature of active frogs can help explain variation in behavioral performance. The two types of activities studied in most detail, jumping and calling, differ markedly in duration and intensity, and there are distinct differences in the metabolic profile and fiber type of the supporting muscles. Characteristics of jumping and calling also vary significantly among species, and these differences have a number of implications that we discuss in some detail throughout this paper. One question that emerges from this topic is whether anuran species exhibit activity temperatures that match the temperature range over which they perform best. Although this seems the case, thermal preferences are variable and may not necessarily reflect typical activity temperatures. The performance versus temperature curves and the thermal limits for anuran activity reflect the thermal ecology of species more than their systematic position. Anuran thermal physiology, therefore, seems to be phenotypically plastic and susceptible to adaptive evolution. Although generalizations regarding the mechanistic basis of such adjustments are not yet possible, recent attempts have been made to reveal the mechanistic basis of acclimation and acclimatization.},

More than a century ago, Charles Darwin hypothesized that the empathy-like phenotype is a phylogenetically widespread phenomenon. This idea remains contentious, partly due to few investigations among non-mammalian vertebrates. We provide evidence for Darwin’s hypothesis by discovering key empathetic features, emotional contagion and ingroup bias, in pair bonding Ranitomeya imitator (Mimetic) poison frogs. We found that the corticosterone level of males appears to positively correlate with female partners across various conditions, including cohabitation and during experimental manipulation. This response is selective towards female partners relative to familiarized female non-partners and is irrespective of partnership longevity or lifetime reproductive output. However, hormonal state matching is not reflected behaviorally, indicating that behavioral state matching can be an unreliable proxy for emotional contagion. These results constitute the first evidence for emotional contagion in an amphibian. Together with findings in other taxa, they suggest empathy is evolutionarily widespread among social vertebrates.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

Extensive evidence suggests that androgens are involved in the modulation of territorial behaviours in male vertebrates. Short-term increase of androgen following a territorial encounter appears to favour the outcome of a challenge. The “Challenge Hypothesis” proposed by Wingfield and colleagues outlines the existence of a positive feedback relationship between androgen and social challenges (e. g., territorial intrusions) in male vertebrates. Here we tested the challenge hypothesis in the highly territorial poison frog, Allobates femoralis, in its natural habitat by exposing males to simulated territorial intrusions in the form of acoustic playbacks. We quantified repeatedly androgen concentrations of individual males via a noninvasive water-borne sampling approach. Our results show that A. femoralis males exhibited a positive behav­ ioural and androgenic response after being confronted to simulated territorial intrusions, providing support for the Challenge Hypothesis in a territorial frog.},

	abstract = {In Chap.10, we presented linear models ({LMs}) models with fixed effects for correlated data. They are examples of population-averaged models, because their mean-structure parameters can be interpreted as effects of covariates on the mean value of the dependent variable in the entire population. The association between the observations in a dataset was a result of a grouping of the observations sharing the same level of a grouping factor(s). In this chapter, we consider the analysis of continuous, hierarchical data using a different class of models, namely, linear mixed-effects models ({LMMs}). They allow to take into account the correlation of observations contained in a dataset. Moreover, they allow to effectively partition the overall variation of the dependent variable into components corresponding to different levels of data hierarchy. The models are examples of subject-specific models, because they include subject-specific coefficients. In particular, in Sects.13.2–13.4, we describe the formulation of the model. Sections13.5,13.6, and13.7 are devoted to, respectively, the estimation approaches, diagnostic tools, and inferential methods used for the {LMMs}, in which the (conditional) residual variance-covariance matrix is independent of the mean value. This is the most common type of {LMMs} used in practice. In Sect.13.8, we focus on the {LMMs}, in which the (conditional) residual variance-covariance matrix depends on the mean value. Section13.9 summarizes the contents of this chapter and offers some general concluding comments.},

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effect models ({LMMs}) are being increasingly widely used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This feature allows {LMMs} to address some of the problems identiﬁed by Speelman and {McGann} (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using {LMM} to analyse skewed reaction time ({RT}) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw {RT} produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identiﬁcation, which conﬂicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed {RT}. Generalized linear mixed-effect models ({GLMM}) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher’s theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a {GLMM}, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.’s datasets. We then consider the broader beneﬁts of using {GLMM} to investigate individual differences.},

	abstract = {The primary rationale for the use of phylogenetically based statistical methods is that phylogenetic signal, the tendency for related species to resemble each other, is ubiquitous. Whether this assertion is true for a given trait in a given lineage is an empirical question, but general tools for detecting and quantifying phylogenetic signal are inadequately developed. We present new methods for continuous-valued characters that can be implemented with either phylogenetically independent contrasts or generalized least-squares models. First, a simple randomization procedure allows one to test the null hypothesis of no pattern of similarity among relatives. The test demonstrates correct Type I error rate at a nominal ␣ ϭ 0.05 and good power (0.8) for simulated datasets with 20 or more species. Second, we derive a descriptive statistic, K, which allows valid comparisons of the amount of phylogenetic signal across traits and trees. Third, we provide two biologically motivated branch-length transformations, one based on the {OrnsteinUhlenbeck} ({OU}) model of stabilizing selection, the other based on a new model in which character evolution can accelerate or decelerate ({ACDC}) in rate (e.g., as may occur during or after an adaptive radiation). Maximum likelihood estimation of the {OU} (d) and {ACDC} (g) parameters can serve as tests for phylogenetic signal because an estimate of d or g near zero implies that a phylogeny with little hierarchical structure (a star) offers a good ﬁt to the data. Transformations that improve the ﬁt of a tree to comparative data will increase power to detect phylogenetic signal and may also be preferable for further comparative analyses, such as of correlated character evolution. Application of the methods to data from the literature revealed that, for trees with 20 or more species, 92\% of traits exhibited signiﬁcant phylogenetic signal (randomization test), including behavioral and ecological ones that are thought to be relatively evolutionarily malleable (e.g., highly adaptive) and/or subject to relatively strong environmental (nongenetic) effects or high levels of measurement error. Irrespective of sample size, most traits (but not body size, on average) showed less signal than expected given the topology, branch lengths, and a Brownian motion model of evolution (i.e., K was less than one), which may be attributed to adaptation and/or measurement error in the broad sense (including errors in estimates of phenotypes, branch lengths, and topology). Analysis of variance of log K for all 121 traits (from 35 trees) indicated that behavioral traits exhibit lower signal than body size, morphological, life-history, or physiological traits. In addition, physiological traits (corrected for body size) showed less signal than did body size itself. For trees with 20 or more species, the estimated {OU} (25\% of traits) and/or {ACDC} (40\%) transformation parameter differed signiﬁcantly from both zero and unity, indicating that a hierarchical tree with less (or occasionally more) structure than the original better ﬁt the data and so could be preferred for comparative analyses.},

	abstract = {The use of {CRISPR}/Cas9 for gene editing offers new opportunities for biology students to perform genuine research exploring the gene-to-phenotype relationship. It is important to introduce the next generation of scientists, health practitioners and other members of society to the technical and ethical aspects of gene editing. Here, we share our experience leading hands-on undergraduate laboratory classes, where students formulate hypotheses regarding the roles of candidate genes involved in development, perform loss-of-function experiments using programmable nucleases and analyze the phenotypic effects of mosaic mutant animals. This is enabled by the use of the amphibian Xenopus laevis and the butterfly Vanessa cardui, two organisms that reliably yield hundreds of large and freshly fertilized eggs in a scalable manner. Frogs and butterflies also present opportunities to teach key biological concepts about gene regulation and development. To complement these practical aspects, we describe learning activities aimed at equipping students with a broad understanding of genome editing techniques, their application in fundamental and translational research, and the bioethical challenges they raise. Overall, our work supports the introduction of {CRISPR} technology into undergraduate classrooms and, when coupled with classroom undergraduate research experiences, enables hypothesis-driven research by undergraduates.},

Navigation studies in amphibians have largely focused on species with life histories that require accurate spatial movements, such as territorial poison frogs and migratory pond-breeding amphibians that show fidelity to mating sites. However, other amphibian species have remained relatively understudied, leaving open the possibility that well-developed navigational abilities are widespread. Here, we measured short-term space use in non-territorial, non-migratory cane toads (Rhinella marina) in their native range in French Guiana. After establishing site fidelity, we tested their ability to return home following translocations of 500 and 1000 m. Toads were able to travel in straight trajectories back to home areas, suggesting navigational abilities similar to those observed in amphibians with more complex spatial behavior. These observations break with the current paradigm of amphibian navigation and suggest that navigational abilities may be widely shared among amphibians.},

	abstract = {Sex differences in vertebrate spatial abilities are typically interpreted under the adaptive specialization hypothesis, which posits that male reproductive success is linked to larger home ranges and better navigational skills. The androgen spillover hypothesis counters that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are expected to outperform males based on life-history traits are key for disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental duties shows wider-ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that the caring sex outperformed the non-caring sex only in one out of three species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative behavior than females. Furthermore, androgen levels correlated with explorative behavior and homing accuracy. Our findings suggest that poison frog reproductive strategies shape space use patterns but not navigational performance, providing counterevidence to the prevailing view of adaptive sex differences in spatial abilities.Competing Interest {StatementThe} authors have declared no competing interest.},

Whiptail lizards (genus Cnemidophorus) are an excellent model system in which to study the evolution of sexual behavior, as both the ancestral and descendent species exist. Male-typical sexual behavior is mediated by progesterone in both the ancestral species and the descendant all-female species, although the molecular characterization and distribution of the progesterone receptor protein throughout the reptilian brain is not well understood. To better understand the gene targets and ligand binding properties of the progesterone receptor in whiptails, we cloned the promoter and coding sequence of the progesterone receptor and analyzed the predicted protein structure. We next determined the distribution of the progesterone receptor protein and {mRNA} throughout the brain of Cnemidophorus inornatus and Cnemidophorus uniparens by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. We found the progesterone receptor to be present in many brain regions known to regulate social behavior and processing of stimulus salience across many vertebrates, including the ventral tegmental area, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and several hypothalamic nuclei. Additionally, we quantified immunoreactive cells in the preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamus in females of both species and males of the ancestral species. We found differences between both species and across ovarian states. Our results significantly extend our understanding of progesterone modulation in the reptilian brain and support the important role of the nuclear progesterone receptor in modulating sexual behavior in reptiles and across vertebrates.},

At the frog neuromuscular junction (nmj), exogenous application of {NO} reduces neurotransmitter release, and {NO} synthases ({NOSs}), the enzymes producing {NO}, are present at this synapse. This work aimed at studying the molecular mechanisms by which {NO} modulates synaptic efficacy at the nmj using electrophysiological recordings and Ca2+-imaging techniques. Bath application of the {NO} donors S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ({SNAP}) and sodium nitroprusside decreased end plate potential ({EPP}) amplitude as well as the frequency of miniature {EPPs} but not their amplitude. Ca2+ responses elicited in presynaptic terminals by single action potentials were unaffected by {NO}, but responses evoked by a short train of stimuli were increased. Tonic endogenous production of {NO} was observed as suggested by the increase in {EPP} amplitude by bath application of the {NO} scavenger hemoglobin and the neuronal {NOS} inhibitor 3-bromo-7-nitroindazole sodium salt. A soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione ({LY}-83583), increased {EPP} amplitude and occluded the effects of the {NO} donor, suggesting that {NO} acts via a {cGMP}-dependent mechanism. High-frequency-induced depression was reduced in the presence of the {NO} scavenger but not by {LY}-83583. However, adenosine-induced depression was significantly reduced after bath perfusion of {SNAP} and in the presence of {LY}-83583. Our results indicate that {NO} regulates transmitter release and adenosine-induced depression via a {cGMP}-dependent mechanism that occurs after Ca2+ entry and that high-frequency-induced synaptic depression is regulated by {NO} in a {cGMP}-independent manner.},

Application of {MK}801 to block neuronal {NMDA} receptor ({NMDAR}) currents confirmed a significant reduction in radial glial filopodial motility. This reduction did not occur in glial cells expressing a dominant-negative form of {cGMP}-dependent protein kinase 1 ({PKG}1), and was prevented by elevation of {cGMP} levels with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil.

Thanks to its indispensable function in competition and thus survival, aggression exists widely across animal species, including humans. Classical works from Tinbergen and Lorenz concluded that instinctive behaviors including aggression are mediated by hardwired brain circuitries that specialize in processing certain sensory inputs to trigger stereotyped motor outputs. They further suggest that instinctive behaviors are influenced by an animal’s internal state and past experiences. Following this conceptual framework, here we review our current understanding regarding the neural substrates underlying aggression generation, highlighting an evolutionarily conserved ‘core aggression circuit’ composed of four subcortical regions. We further discuss the neural mechanisms that support changes in aggression based on the animal’s internal state. We aim to provide an overview of features of aggression and the relevant neural substrates across species, highlighting findings in rodents, primates and songbirds.},

	abstract = {Aggressive behavior plays an essential role in survival and reproduction across animal species—it has been observed in insects, fish, reptiles, and mammals including humans. Even though specific aggressive behaviors are quite heterogeneous across species, many of the underlying mechanisms modulating aggression are highly conserved. For example, in a variety of species arginine vasopressin ({AVP}) and its homologue vasotocin in the hypothalamus, play an important role in regulating aggressive behaviorssuch as territorial and inter male aggression. Similarly in the medial amygdala, activation of a subpopulation of {GABAergic} neurons promotes aggression, while the prefrontal cortex exerts inhibitory control over aggressive behaviors. An important caveat in the aggression literature is that it is focused primarily on males, probably because in most species males are more aggressive than females. However, female aggression is also highly prevalent in many contexts, as it can affect access to resources such as mates, food, and offspring survival. Although it is likely that many underlying mechanisms are shared between sexes, there is sex specific variation in aggression, type, magnitude, and contexts, which suggests that there are important sex differences in how aggression is regulated. For example, while {AVP} acts to modulate aggression in both male and female hamsters, it increases male aggression but decreases female aggression. These differences can occur at the extent of neurotransmitter or hormones release, sensitivity (i.e., receptor expression), and/or molecular responses.},

	abstract = {Dysregulated aggressive behaviour has important negative consequences for human societies. A complicating factor is that aggression that is exhibited in different social contexts can be regulated by different neurobiological mechanisms.Neurobiological studies have identified a subset of hypothalamic and limbic brain areas that tend to facilitate aggressive behaviour in rodents and primates. In contrast, neural activity in the frontal cortex generally acts to inhibit aggressive behaviour.Aggressive behaviours in animal models and humans are known to be regulated by serotonin neurotransmission. Behaviour can be modified at several levels, including regulation of serotonin release, reuptake and sensitivity (via serotonin receptors).Dopaminergic function appears to be necessary for aggressive behaviour, possibly by regulating arousal, learning and memory.Neuronal nitric oxide ({nNOS}) synthase signalling (via nitric oxide gas) exerts inhibitory effects on male aggression in rodents. Several studies suggest that {nNOS} assists in the processing of salient social stimuli.Mutations in the monoamine oxidase A ({MAOA}) enzyme are associated with increased aggressive behaviours in humans. {MAOA} knockout mice show increased aggression.Steroid hormones have long been a focus of aggression research, but the relationship among androgens, oestrogens and behaviour is complex. These hormones do not function in isolation and their actions are affected by the environmental context.Gene–environment interactions have important effects on aggressive behaviours. Mutations or hormones that increase aggression in one environment have no effect (or decrease aggression) in different environments.Novel pharmacological treatments must target specific subtypes of aggression to have improved effectiveness. An appreciation of the contribution of environmental stressors to aggressive phenotypes is necessary for further advancements in the successful management of maladaptive aggression.},

	abstract = {Aggressive competition for resources among juveniles is documented in many species, but the neural mechanisms regulating this behavior in young animals are poorly understood. In poison frogs, increased parental care is associated with decreased water volume of tadpole pools, resource limitation, and aggression. Indeed, the tadpoles of many poison frog species will attack, kill, and cannibalize other tadpoles. We examined the neural basis of conspecific aggression in Dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) tadpoles by comparing individuals that won aggressive encounters, lost aggressive encounters, or did not engage in a fight. We first compared patterns of generalized neural activity using immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated ribosomes ({pS}6) as a proxy for neural activation associated with behavior. We found increased neural activity in the medial pallium and preoptic area of loser tadpoles, suggesting the amphibian homologs of the mammalian hippocampus and preoptic area may facilitate loser-associated behaviors. Nonapeptides (arginine vasotocin and mesotocin) and dopamine have been linked to aggression in other vertebrates and are located in the preoptic area. We next examined neural activity specifically in nonapeptide- and tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive cells using double-label immunohistochemistry. We found increased neural activity specifically in the preoptic area nonapeptide neurons of winners, whereas we found no differences in activity of dopaminergic cells among behavioral groups. Our findings suggest the neural correlates of aggression in poison frog tadpoles are similar to neural mechanisms mediating aggression in adults and juveniles of other vertebrate taxa.},

Male {nNOS}-1K/K mice are more aggressive than wild-type ({WT}) mice in all testing paradigms. Testosterone is necessary, but not sufﬁcient, for evoking the persistent aggression, and that serotonin (5-{HT}) metabolism is altered in male {nNOS}-1K/K mice. The speciﬁc deletion of the {nNOS}-1 gene not only results in a lack of {nNOS}-1 protein, but in common with many genes, affects several ‘downstream’ processes. In this review, we address whether the elevated aggression in male {nNOS}-1K/K mice reﬂects pleiotropic effects of the {nNOS}-1 gene on pain sensitivity, ‘anxiety-like’, or ‘depressive-like’ behaviors. For example, male {nNOS}-1K/K mice display increased sensitivity to painful stimuli, which may prolong aggressive interactions. Despite elevated corticosterone concentrations, {nNOS}-1 knockout mice appear to be less ‘anxious’ or fearful than {WT} mice. Male {nNOS}-1K/K mice display longer latencies to right themselves on an inverted platform and spend more time in the center of an open ﬁeld than {WT} mice. Because of reduced serotonin turnover, the excessive aggressiveness displayed by {nNOS}-1K/K mice may be symptomatic of a depressive-like syndrome. However, {nNOS}-1K/K mice rarely display behavioral ‘despair’ when assessed with the Porsolt forced swim test; rather, {nNOS}-1K/K mice show vigorous swimming throughout the assessment suggesting that the aggressive behavior does not represent depressive-like behavior. Importantly, aggressive behavior is not a unitary process, but is the result of complex interactions among several physiological, motivational, and behavioral systems, with contributions from the social as well as the physical environment. Lastly, the multiple, and often unanticipated, effects of targeted gene disruption on aggressive behavior are considered.},

Although the dietary acquisition of chemical defenses in poison frogs is well documented, the physiological mechanisms of alkaloid sequestration has not been investigated. Here, we used {RNA} sequencing and proteomics to determine how alkaloids impact {mRNA} or protein abundance in the little devil frog (Oophaga sylvatica), and compared wild-caught chemically defended frogs with laboratory frogs raised on an alkaloid-free diet. To understand how poison frogs move alkaloids from their diet to their skin granular glands, we focused on measuring gene expression in the intestines, skin and liver. Across these tissues, we found many differentially expressed transcripts involved in small molecule transport and metabolism, as well as sodium channels and other ion pumps. We then used proteomic approaches to quantify plasma proteins, where we found several protein abundance differences between wild and laboratory frogs, including the amphibian neurotoxin binding protein saxiphilin. Finally, because many blood proteins are synthesized in the liver, we used thermal proteome profiling as an untargeted screen for soluble proteins that bind the alkaloid decahydroquinoline. Using this approach, we identified several candidate proteins that interact with this alkaloid, including saxiphilin. These transcript and protein abundance patterns suggest that the presence of alkaloids influences frog physiology and that small molecule transport proteins may be involved in toxin bioaccumulation in dendrobatid poison frogs.},

	abstract = {Temperament describes the idea that individual behavioural differences are repeatable over time and across situations. This common phenomenon covers numerous traits, such as aggressiveness, avoidance of novelty, willingness to take risks, exploration, and sociality. The study of temperament is central to animal psychology, behavioural genetics, pharmacology, and animal husbandry, but relatively few studies have examined the ecology and evolution of temperament traits. This situation is surprising, given that temperament is likely to exert an important influence on many aspects of animal ecology and evolution, and that individual variation in temperament appears to be pervasive amongst animal species. Possible explanations for this neglect of temperament include a perceived irrelevance, an insufficient understanding of the link between temperament traits and fitness, and a lack of coherence in terminology with similar traits often given different names, or different traits given the same name. We propose that temperament can and should be studied within an evolutionary ecology framework and provide a terminology that could be used as a working tool for ecological studies of temperament. Our terminology includes five major temperament trait categories: shyness-boldness, explorationavoidance, activity, sociability and aggressiveness. This terminology does not make inferences regarding underlying dispositions or psychological processes, which may have restrained ecologists and evolutionary biologists from working on these traits. We present extensive literature reviews that demonstrate that temperament traits are heritable, and linked to fitness and to several other traits of importance to ecology and evolution. Furthermore, we describe ecologically relevant measurement methods and point to several ecological and evolutionary topics that would benefit from considering temperament, such as phenotypic plasticity, conservation biology, population sampling, and invasion biology.},

We investigated the endocrine underpinnings of female mate choice in the African cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni, a non-seasonal breeder. In addition to profiling behavioral and hormonal changes across the female reproductive cycle, we tested two hypotheses regarding possible factors influencing female mate choice. We first asked whether female mate choice is influenced by male visual and/or chemical cues. A. burtoni females were housed for one full reproductive cycle in the center of a dichotomous choice apparatus with a large (attractive) or small (unattractive) conspecific male on either side. Females associated mostly with small, less attractive males, but on the day of spawning reversed their preference to large, attractive males, with whom they mated almost exclusively, although this choice depended on the relative amount of androgens released into the water by small males. We next asked whether male behavior or androgen levels change in relation to the stimulus females' reproductive state. We found that stimulus male aggression decreased and reproductive displays increased as the day of spawning approached. Moreover male testosterone levels changed throughout the females' reproductive cycle, with larger males releasing more testosterone into the water than small males. Our data suggest that female association in a dichotomous choice assay is only indicative of the actual mate choice on the day of spawning. Furthermore, we show that male behavior and hormone levels are dependent on the reproductive state of conspecific females.},

Within amphibians, maternal provisioning has evolved multiple times, with mothers of some species feeding unfertilized eggs to their developing offspring until tadpoles complete metamorphosis [1–3]. We conducted ﬁeld studies in Ecuador and Madagascar to ask whether convergence at the behavioral level provides similar beneﬁts to offspring and relies on shared neural mechanisms in dendrobatid and mantellid poison frogs. At an ecological level, we found that nursing allows poison frogs to provide chemical defenses to their tadpoles in both species. At the neural level, nursing was associated with increased activity in the lateral septum and preoptic area, demonstrating recruitment of shared brain regions in the convergent evolution of nursing within frogs and across vertebrates [4]. In contrast, only mantellids showed increased oxytocin neuron activity akin to that in nursing mammals [5], suggesting evolutionary versatility in molecular mechanisms. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that maternal provisioning provides similar potential beneﬁts to offspring and relies on similar brain regions in poison frog species with convergently evolved toxicity and maternal care.},

	abstract = {Testosterone (T) is often referred to as the “male hormone,” but it can inﬂuence aggression, parental behavior, and immune function in both males and females. By experimentally relating hormone-induced changes in phenotype to ﬁtness, it is possible to ask whether existing phenotypes perform better or worse than alternative phenotypes, and hence to predict how selection might act on a novel or rare phenotype. In a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), we have examined the effects of experimentally elevated T in females on ﬁtness-related behaviors such as parental care. In this study, we implanted female juncos with exogenous T and examined its effect on ﬁtness (survival, reproduction, and extra-pair mating) to assess whether T-altered phenotypes would prove to be adaptive or deleterious for females. Experimental elevation of T decreased the likelihood that a female would breed successfully, and T-implanted females had lower total reproductive success at every stage of the reproductive cycle. They did not, however, differ from control females in ﬂedgling quality, extra-pair offspring production, survival, or reproduction in the following year. Previous work in this system has shown that experimental elevation of T in males alters behavior and physiology and decreases survival but increases the production of extra-pair offspring, leading to higher net ﬁtness relative to control animals. Our results suggest that increased T has divergent effects on male and female ﬁtness in this species, and that prevailing levels in females may be adaptive for them. These ﬁndings are consistent with sexual conﬂict.},

	abstract = {To explore whether selection for testosterone-mediated traits in males might be constrained by costs of higher testosterone to females, we examined the effects of experimental elevation of plasma testosterone on physiological, reproductive, and behavioral parameters in a female songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis). We used subcutaneous implants to elevate testosterone (T) in captive and freeliving female juncos. In captive birds, we measured the effects of high T on body mass, feather molt, and brood patch formation. In the field, we monitored its effects on the timing of egg laying, clutch size, egg size, egg steroid levels, incubation, and nest-defense behavior. Females implanted with testosterone (T-females) had significantly higher circulating levels of testosterone than did control females (Cfemales). Captive T-females had lower body mass, were less likely to develop brood patches, and delayed feather molt relative to Cfemales. Among free-living females, the interval between nest completion and appearance of the first egg was longer for T-females than for C-females and egg yolk concentrations of testosterone were higher, but there were no significant differences in estradiol levels, clutch size, or egg size. Incubation and nest defense behavior were also similar between T- and C-females. Our results suggest that selection on males for higher testosterone might initially lead to a correlated response in females producing changes in body mass and feather molt, both of which could be detrimental. Other possible female responses would be delayed onset of reproduction, which might reduce reproductive success, and higher yolk testosterone, which might have either positive or negative effects on offspring development. We found no reason to expect reduced parental behavior by females as a negative fitness consequence of selection for higher testosterone in males.},

Directional selection for male ornaments could theoretically increase male testosterone levels over evolutionary timescales, and when genetically correlated, female testosterone levels as well. Because of the negative ﬁtness consequences of high testosterone, it is plausible that female choice for sexually selected traits in males results in decreased female reproductive ﬁtness. I used comparative analysis to examine the association between male peak testosterone expression and sexually selected ornaments. I also tested for genetic correlation between male and female androgen levels. The presence of sexually selected traits in males was signiﬁcantly correlated with increased peak androgen levels in males as well as females, and female testosterone levels were signiﬁcantly correlated with male peak testosterone titers, although the slope was only marginally !1. This suggests that selection to decouple high male and female testosterone levels is either weak or otherwise ineffective.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-11-498},
	abstract = {Background: Aggression is a near-universal behaviour with substantial influence on and implications for human and animal social systems. The neurophysiological basis of aggression is, however, poorly understood in all species and approaches adopted to study this complex behaviour have often been oversimplified. We applied targeted expression profiling on 40 genes, spanning eight neurological pathways and in four distinct regions of the brain, in combination with behavioural observations and pharmacological manipulations, to screen for regulatory pathways of aggression in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), an animal model in which social rank and aggressiveness tightly correlate.
Results: Substantial differences occurred in gene expression profiles between dominant and subordinate males associated with phenotypic differences in aggressiveness and, for the chosen gene set, they occurred mainly in the hypothalamus and telencephalon. The patterns of differentially-expressed genes implied multifactorial control of aggression in zebrafish, including the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial-system, serotonin, somatostatin, dopamine, hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal, hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal and histamine pathways, and the latter is a novel finding outside mammals. Pharmacological manipulations of various nodes within the hypothalamoneurohypophysial-system and serotonin pathways supported their functional involvement. We also observed differences in expression profiles in the brains of dominant versus subordinate females that suggested sexconserved control of aggression. For example, in the {HNS} pathway, the gene encoding arginine vasotocin ({AVT}), previously believed specific to male behaviours, was amongst those genes most associated with aggression, and {AVT} inhibited dominant female aggression, as in males. However, sex-specific differences in the expression profiles also occurred, including differences in aggression-associated tryptophan hydroxylases and estrogen receptors.
Conclusions: Thus, through an integrated approach, combining gene expression profiling, behavioural analyses, and pharmacological manipulations, we identified candidate genes and pathways that appear to play significant roles in regulating aggression in fish. Many of these are novel for non-mammalian systems. We further present a validated system for advancing our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of complex behaviours using a fish model.},

Moreover, when studying male challenge effects, researchers have rarely investigated other hormones that can be important to the expression of aggression, such as progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2). We conducted 10-min aggression trials using the resident–intruder paradigm in cycling female California mice, Peromyscus californicus, a species in which both sexes show territorial behavior. By comparing the hormone levels of test females to control females, we found a decrease in P4 and the P4/T ratio, but no change in T, E2, corticosterone, E2/P4, or E2/T. Interestingly, these hormone changes were observed even when the resident was not aggressive toward the intruder, suggesting that the stimulus cueing the hormone changes was the mere presence of the intruder and not the amount of aggression displayed by the resident. Generally, T has a positive relationship with aggression, whereas P4 inhibits male and nonmaternal female aggression. Thus, decreasing the P4/T ratio following an encounter may serve to increase future aggression in females. These results suggest that females may use different hormonal mechanisms than do males to mediate aggression in a challenge situation.},

	abstract = {Aggressive behaviors are widespread among animals and are critical in the competition for resources. The physiological mechanisms underlying aggression have mostly been examined in breeding males, in which gonadal androgens, acting in part through their aromatization to estrogens, have a key role. There are two alternative models that contribute to further understanding hormonal mechanisms underlying aggression: aggression displayed in the non-breeding season, when gonadal steroids are low, and female aggression. In this study we approach, for the ﬁrst time, the modulatory role of estrogens and androgens upon non-breeding aggression in a wild female teleost ﬁsh. We characterized female aggression in the weakly electric ﬁsh Gymnotus omarorum and carried out acute treatments 1 h prior to agonistic encounters in dyads treated with either an aromatase inhibitor or an antagonist of androgen receptors. Anti-androgen treatment had no eﬀect on behavior whereas acute aromatase inhibition caused a strong distortion of aggressive behavior. Territorial non-breeding aggression was robust and depended on rapid estrogen actions to maintain high levels of aggression, and ultimately reach conﬂict resolution from which dominant/subordinate status emerged. Our results, taken together with our own reports in males and the contributions from non-breeding aggression in bird and mammal models, suggest a common strategy involving fast-acting estrogens in the control of this behavior across species. In addition, further analysis of female non-breeding aggression may shed light on potential sexual diﬀerences in the ﬁne tuning of social behaviors.},

	abstract = {In 1849, Berthold demonstrated that testicular secretions are necessary for aggressive behavior in roosters. Since then, research on the neuroendocrinology of aggression has been dominated by the paradigm that the brain receives gonadal hormones, primarily testosterone, which modulate relevant neural circuits. While this paradigm has been extremely useful, recent studies reveal important alternatives. For example, most vertebrate species are seasonal breeders, and many species show aggression outside of the breeding season, when gonads are regressed and circulating testosterone levels are typically low. Studies in birds and mammals suggest that an adrenal androgen precursor—dehydroepiandrosterone ({DHEA})—may be important for the expression of aggression when gonadal testosterone synthesis is low. Circulating {DHEA} can be metabolized into active sex steroids within the brain. Another possibility is that the brain can autonomously synthesize sex steroids de novo from cholesterol, thereby uncoupling brain steroid levels from circulating steroid levels. These alternative neuroendocrine mechanisms to provide sex steroids to speciﬁc neural circuits may have evolved to avoid the ‘‘costs” of high circulating testosterone during particular seasons. Physiological indicators of season (e.g., melatonin) may allow animals to switch from one neuroendocrine mechanism to another across the year. Such mechanisms may be important for the control of aggression in many vertebrate species, including humans.},

However, individual variation in aggressiveness does not always relate to circulating T, suggesting that behavioural variation may be more closely related to neural sensitivity to steroids, though this issue remains unresolved. To assess the relative importance of circulating T and neural steroid sensitivity in predicting behaviour, we measured aggressiveness during staged intrusions in free-living male and female dark-eyed juncos (
              Junco hyemalis
              ). We compared aggressiveness to plasma T levels and to the abundance of androgen receptor ({AR}), aromatase ({AROM}) and oestrogen receptor alpha ({ORα}) {mRNA} in behaviourally relevant brain areas (avian medial amygdala, hypothalamus and song control regions). We also asked whether patterns of covariation among behaviour and endocrine parameters differed in males and females, anticipating that circulating T may be a better predictor of behaviour in males than in females. We found that circulating T related to aggressiveness only in males, but that gene expression for {ORα}, {AR} and {AROM} covaried with individual differences in aggressiveness in both sexes. These findings are among the first to show that individual variation in neural gene expression for three major sex steroid-processing molecules predicts individual variation in aggressiveness in both sexes in nature. The results have broad implications for our understanding of the mechanisms by which aggressive behaviour may evolve.},

	abstract = {Steroid hormones play an important role in regulating vertebrate sexual behavior. In frogs and toads, injections of exogenous gonadotropins, which stimulate steroid hormone production, are often used to induce reproductive behavior, but steroid hormones alone are not always sufﬁcient. To determine which hormonal conditions promote sexual behavior in female túngara frogs, we assessed the effect of hormone manipulation on the probability of phonotaxis behavior toward conspeciﬁc calls in post-reproductive females. We injected females with human chorionic gonadotropin ({HCG}), estradiol, estradiol plus progesterone, saline, or {HCG} plus fadrozole (an aromatase blocker) and tested their responses to mating calls. We found that injections of {HCG}, estradiol, and estradiol plus progesterone all increased phonotaxis behavior, whereas injections of saline or {HCG} plus fadrozole did not. Since injections of estradiol alone were effective at increasing phonotaxis behavior, we concluded that estradiol is sufﬁcient for the expression of phonotaxis behavior. Next, to determine if estradiol-injected females display the same behavioral preferences as naturally breeding females, we compared mating call preferences of naturally breeding females to those of post-reproductive females injected with estradiol. We found that, when injected with estradiol, females show similar call preferences as naturally breeding females, although they were less likely to respond across multiple phonotaxis tests. Overall, our results suggest that estradiol is sufﬁcient for the expression of sexual responses to mating calls in túngara frogs. To our knowledge, ours is the only study to ﬁnd that estradiol alone is capable of promoting phonotaxis behavior in a frog.},

Here we test the role of aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into estradiol, in mediating aggression and reproductive behavior in male Astatotilapia burtoni, an African cichlid ﬁsh that displays remarkable plasticity in social behavior. We ﬁrst measured aromatase expression in subordinate and dominant males in brain regions that regulate social behavior and found that subordinate males have higher aromatase expression than dominant males in the magnocellular and gigantocellular regions of the preoptic area. Next, we functionally tested the role of aromatase in regulating behavior by intraperitoneally injecting dominant males with either saline or fadrozole ({FAD}), an aromatase inhibitor, and found that {FAD} treatment decreases aggressive, but not reproductive, behaviors compared to saline controls. To determine the underlying physiological and molecular consequences of {FAD} treatment, we measured estradiol and testosterone levels from plasma and brain aromatase expression in {FAD} and saline treated dominant males. We found that estradiol levels decreased and testosterone levels increased in response to {FAD} treatment. Moreover, {FAD} treated males had increased aromatase expression in the gigantocellular portion of the {POA}, possibly a compensatory response. Overall, our results suggest aromatase is a key enzyme that promotes aggression in A. burtoni males through actions in the preoptic area. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Steroid hormones play a central role in vertebrate reproduction and may be associated with life-history trade-offs. Consequently, circulating concentrations of these hormones vary tremendously across vertebrates, yet interspeciﬁc geographic variation in male hormone concentrations has been studied in detail only in birds. We here report on such variation in amphibians and reptiles, conﬁrming patterns observed in birds. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we found that in amphibians, but not in reptiles, testosterone and baseline corticosterone were positively related to latitude. Baseline corticosterone was negatively related to elevation in amphibians but not in reptiles. For both groups, testosterone concentrations were negatively related to breeding-season length. In addition, testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with baseline corticosterone in both groups. Our ﬁndings may best be explained by the hypothesis that shorter breeding seasons increase male-male competition, which may favor increased testosterone concentrations that modulate secondary sexual traits. Elevated energetic demands resulting from greater reproductive intensity may require higher baseline corticosterone. Thus, the positive relationship between testosterone and corticosterone in both groups suggests an energetic demand for testosterone-regulated behavior that is met with increased baseline glucocorticoid concentrations.},

In a variety of species of birds that display paternal care, testosterone (T) levels in males are maintained at low levels, and these levels rise only in response to direct agonistic challenges. This idea has not been thoroughly studied in mammals with biparental care, and we exposed male marmosets (Callithrix kuhlii), a monogamous and biparental primate to aggressive interactions with unfamiliar intruders. Urinary levels of T and cortisol ({CORT}) were monitored prior to and following these interactions. Baseline T was not correlated with variation in aggression in either residents or intruders, and {CORT} was not affected by the encounters. However, males responded to an encounter with male intruders with changes in T that correlated with the level of aggression displayed by the resident male during the trial. Encounters with male intruders that elicited high frequencies of aggressive displays by the male resident were associated with increased T 2–6 h and 24 h following the encounter, and encounters that had few aggressive displays resulted in no change or a decrease in T concentrations. Intruders did not demonstrate a significant relationship between T and aggression. Thus, the magnitude of the hormonal response is dependent on the intensity of aggression during a male–male encounter, suggesting that elevated androgens are likely to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of aggressive interactions in marmosets.},

Here, we report how divergence in physiology may contribute to the stable coexistence of two hybridizing incipient species of cichlid ﬁsh from Lake Victoria. Males of Pundamilia nyererei (males are red) tend to defeat those of Pundamilia pundamilia (males are blue), yet the two sibling species coexist in nature. It has been suggested that red males bear a physiological cost that might offset their dominance advantage. We tested the hypothesis that the two species differ in oxidative stress levels and immune function and that this difference is correlated with differences in circulating steroid levels. We manipulated the social context and found red males experienced signiﬁcantly higher oxidative stress levels than blue males, but only in a territorial context when colour and aggression are maximally expressed. Red males exhibited greater aggression levels and lower humoral immune response than blue males, but no detectable difference in steroid levels. Red males appear to trade off increased aggressiveness with physiological costs, contributing to the coexistence of the two species. Correlated divergence in colour, behaviour and physiology might be widespread in the dramatically diverse cichlid radiations in East African lakes and may play a crucial role in the remarkably rapid speciation of these ﬁsh.},

Introduced males showed suppressed levels of T in the presence of both resident males and females, whereas resident males showed elevated T in response to introduced males but not females. Plasma 11-{KT} levels were unchanged in either resident or introduced males. Resident males showed increased activity in the presence of males but not females. Resident females showed an increase in activity when paired with introduced females and greater aggressive behaviour towards females than males. There were no differences in plasma hormone levels in either resident or introduced female fish. Plasma cortisol levels were low in all fish and stress effects did not appear to account for differences in T levels in males. The results of the present study show that elevations in plasma T levels in resident male spiny damselfish are associated only with male presence but that suppression of T in introduced fish occurs irrespective of the sex of the resident. In contrast resident females, which show stronger evidence of aggressive behaviour do not show changes in plasma androgen levels. This suggests that aggressive behaviour in male and female fishes may be mediated by different endocrine pathways.},

	abstract = {Global climate change is negatively impacting global biodiversity and ectothermic vertebrates, with amphibians being the most imperiled vertebrate taxa. Increased mean global atmospheric temperatures, high rates of habitat degradation, and exposure to infectious diseases, such as chytridiomycosis, have contributed to population declines and extinctions of rare and endangered amphibian species. Field-based monitoring of physiological endocrine traits can help determine the sub-lethal effects of environmental stressors and provide early alerts when populations are chronically stressed. Recent advances in amphibian stress endocrinology include the development and use of non-invasive methods to quantify the glucocorticoid, or stress biomarker, corticosterone. Non-invasive methods, such as urinary, skin and buccal swabs, and water-borne hormone monitoring methods (suited for terrestrial and aquatic dwelling species), are available to quantify baseline and short-term physiological stress responses of amphibians under ﬁeld settings. In this review, we illustrate, by using two case studies of aquatic and terrestrial amphibian species, the applications of non-invasive corticosterone monitoring methods to advance the ecological knowledge and conservation of imperiled amphibian species, discuss the limitations of these methods, and provide future directions for the use of non-invasive hormone monitoring methods. We highlight the use of non-invasive ﬁeld endocrinology methods to monitor the impacts of environmental stressors on the physiology of amphibians, which can be applied to advance ecological research, conservation, and management of imperiled species.},

	abstract = {When competition for sex-speciﬁc resources overlaps in time with offspring production and care, trade-offs can occur. Steroid hormones, particularly testosterone (T), play a crucial role in mediating such trade-offs in males, often increasing competitive behaviors while decreasing paternal behavior. Recent research has shown that females also face such trade-offs; however, we know little about the role of T in mediating female phenotypes in general, and the role of T in mediating trade-offs in females in particular. Here we examine the relationship between individual variation in maternal effort and endogenous T in the dark-eyed junco, a common songbird. Speciﬁcally, we measure circulating T before and after a physiological challenge (injection of gonadotropin releasing hormone, {GnRH}), and determine whether either measure is related to provisioning, brooding, or the amount of T sequestered in egg yolk. We found that females producing more T in response to a challenge spent less time brooding nestlings, but provisioned nestlings more frequently, and deposited more T in their eggs. These ﬁndings suggest that, while T is likely important in mediating maternal phenotypes and female life history tradeoffs, the direction of the relationships between T and phenotype may differ from what is generally observed in males, and that high levels of endogenous T are not necessarily as costly as previous work might suggest.},

A previous study showed that testosterone-implanted males were more aggressive than controls, suggesting a greater degree of success in male-male competition. Results of the present study show that the same testosterone-implanted lizards experiencedgreatermortality. Testosterone-treated males were also seen more frequently and more conspicuous ones were less likely to survive. Testosterone-treated males lost more weight over the summer. In controls, survivorship was negatively correlatedwith the body weight index. These data suggest that conspicuousness and energetic demands interact in their influence on survivorship.Thus, the naturalplasma level of testosterone may be at an optimal level balancing any potential selection pressures for a higher level of testosterone through sexual selection with selection pressures for a lower level through a decrease in survivorship.},

	abstract = {The negative co-variation of life-history traits such as fecundity and lifespan across species suggests the existence of ubiquitous trade-offs. Mechanistically, trade-offs result from the need to differentially allocate limited resources to traits like reproduction versus selfmaintenance, with selection favoring the evolution of optimal allocation mechanism. Here I discuss the physiological (endocrine) mechanisms that underlie optimal allocation rules and how such rules evolve. The hormone testosterone may mediate life-history trade-offs due to its pleiotropic actions in male vertebrates. Conservation in the actions of testosterone in vertebrates has prompted the ‘evolutionary constraint hypothesis,’ which assumes that testosterone signaling mechanisms and male traits evolve as a unit. This hypothesis implies that the actions of testosterone are similar across sexes and species, and only the levels of circulating testosterone concentrations change during evolution. In contrast, the ‘evolutionary potential hypothesis’ proposes that testosterone signaling mechanisms and male traits evolve independently. In the latter scenario, the linkage between hormone and traits itself can be shaped by selection, leading to variation in trade-off functions. I will review recent case studies supporting the evolutionary potential hypothesis and suggest micro-evolutionary experiments to unravel the mechanistic basis of lifehistory evolution. {BioEssays} 29:133–144, 2007.},

	abstract = {Research on male animals suggests that the hormone testosterone plays a central role in mediating the trade-off between mating effort and parental effort. However, the direct links between testosterone, intrasexual aggression and parental care are remarkably mixed across species. Previous attempts to reconcile these patterns suggest that selection favors behavioral insensitivity to testosterone when paternal care is essential to reproductive success and when breeding seasons are especially short. Females also secrete testosterone, though the degree to which similar testosterone-mediated trade-offs occur in females is much less clear. Here, I ask whether testosterone mediates trade-offs between aggression and incubation in females, and whether patterns of female sensitivity to testosterone relate to female life history, as is often the case in males. I experimentally elevated testosterone in free-living, incubating female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), a songbird with a short breeding season during which female incubation and intrasexual aggression are both essential to female reproductive success. Testosterone-treated females showed significantly elevated aggression, reduced incubation temperatures, and reduced hatching success, relative to controls. Thus, prolonged testosterone elevation during incubation was detrimental to reproductive success, but females nonetheless showed behavioral sensitivity to testosterone. These findings suggest that the relative importance of both mating effort and parental effort may be central to understanding patterns of behavioral sensitivity in both sexes.},

	abstract = {Female–female aggression often functions in competition over reproductive or social benefits, but the proximate mechanisms of this apparently adaptive behaviour are not well understood. The sex steroid hormone testosterone (T) and its metabolites are well-established mediators of male–male aggression, and several lines of evidence suggest that T-mediated mechanisms may apply to females as well. However, a key question is whether mechanisms of female aggression primarily reflect correlated evolutionary responses to selection acting on males, or whether direct selection acting on females has made modifications to these mechanisms that are adaptive in light of female life history. Here, I examine the degree to which female aggression is mediated at the level of T production, target tissue sensitivity to T, or downstream genomic responses in order to test the hypothesis that selection favours mechanisms that facilitate female aggression while minimizing the costs of systemically elevated T. I draw heavily from avian systems, including the dark-eyed junco (
              Junco hyemalis
              ), as well as other organisms in which these mechanisms have been well studied from an evolutionary/ecological perspective in both sexes. Findings reveal that the sexes share many behavioural and hormonal mechanisms, though several patterns also suggest sex-specific adaptation. I argue that greater attention to multiple levels of analysis—from hormone to receptor to gene network, including analyses of individual variation that represents the raw material of evolutionary change—will be a fruitful path for understanding mechanisms of behavioural regulation and intersexual coevolution.},

To integrate these perspectives, we consider how suites of traits mediated by the same hormone in both sexes might respond to selection. In male birds, plasma testosterone (T) varies seasonally and among species according to mating system. When elevated experimentally, it is known to enhance some components of ﬁtness and to decrease others. We report that female T also varies seasonally and co-varies with male T. Female T is higher in relation to male T in sexually monomorphic species and is higher absolutely in females of species with socially monogamous mating systems, which suggests adaptation. We also consider the effect of experimentally elevated T on females and whether traits are sensitive to altered T. We hypothesize that sensitive traits could become subject to selection after a natural change in T and that traits with opposing ﬁtness consequences in males and females could constrain dimorphism. Results from birds, including the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), reveal many sensitive traits, some of which appear costly and may help to account for observed levels of sexual dimorphism.},

In mammalian species generally the male is more aggressive than the female; this sex difference is enhanced by the presence of circulating androgen, but androgen exercises its facilitative effect on aggressive behaviour only in animals which have differentiated sexually as males. The direction of the sex difference in fearfulness among mammalian species is more variable. In rodents, the female is less fearful than the male, while in man the reverse is true. The scanty evidence on primates suggests that the human direction of the sex difference in fearfulness may also be characteristic of other primates. Although less clear-cut than is the case for aggressive behaviour, the data on rodents suggest that the sex difference in fearfulness depends in part on the level of circulating oestrogen, which decreases fearful behaviour, and in part on the normal processes of sexual differentiation. The evidence from primates suggests the possibility that, even though the sex difference in fearfulness takes the reverse direction in this order from that in rodents, oestrogen continues to exert an antagonistic action on fear.},

Since aggression is a costly behavior, individuals should account for multiple factors such as population density or reproductive status before engaging in aggression. Previous work has shown that male California mice (Peromyscus californicus) respond to winning aggressive encounters by initiating aggression more quickly in future encounters, and we investigated the physiological basis for this effect. We found that injections that produced a transient increase in testosterone (T) following an aggressive encounter caused males to behave more aggressively in an encounter the following day. Experience alone was not enough to change aggression, as males treated with saline injections showed no change in aggression. The effect of T injections on aggression was androgen-based, as the inhibition of aromatase did not block the T injections from increasing aggression. Aromatase inhibition did, however, increase aggression in the initial aggression tests (before application of T or saline injections), and aromatase activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ({BNST}) was negatively correlated with aggression. A previous study suggested that aromatase activity in the {BNST} decreases after males become fathers. Thus, distinct neuroendocrine mechanisms allow male California mice to adjust aggressive behavior in response to changes in social and reproductive status.},

Mapping of parental care behaviors on the phylogenetic tree derived from the molecular analysis suggests that female-only care has evolved once within Dendrobates, after passing through a biparental stage involving male egg attendance and female tadpole transport and feeding. Phylogenetic analysis also suggests that female provisioning behaviors observed in some Amazonian species of poison frogs may have arisen independently from male care in this genus. Low levels of divergence between members of previously delimited groups within Dendrobates suggest that the members of these groups from Central and South America may have speciated relatively recently (after the formation of the current Panamanian land bridge in the Pliocene).},

A recent study on species delineation in Anomaloglossus, a genus endemic to the Guiana Shield, demonstrated the existence of two undescribed species previously identified as A. degranvillei, which we describe herein. In addition to divergence at the molecular level, these two new taxa are also distinguished by subtle morphological characters and substantial differences in the advertisement calls (note length, dominant frequency, note structure). One species occurs in the hilly lowlands of north-eastern French Guiana and is mainly distinguished from its closest relatives by a small body size (15.9–18.8 mm in males) and by vocalisations characterized by the emission of short notes of 0.09 s on average. The other species is only known from the Itoupé Massif in southern French Guiana and is mainly distinguished from its closest relatives by a moderate body size (19.4–20.4 mm in males) and by vocalisations characterized by the emission of long notes of 0.23 s on average. We also provide amended definitions for two previously described species in the A. degranvillei species group: A. degranvillei, which is endemic to a few massifs in central French Guiana, and A. surinamensis, which is distributed throughout Suriname and French Guiana. The new species described here and A. degranvillei have very narrow ranges within French Guiana and seem to have rapidly declined during the last decade. Therefore, we suggest A. degranvillei and A. dewynteri to be considered as “Critically Endangered” and A. blanci as “Vulnerable” according to the {IUCN} standards.},

In this paper, we redescribe A. baeobatrachus based on newly collected material from the species type locality and provide information about its reproductive ecology. We also provide an amended definition of A. leopardus using newly collected material from its type locality. These two species form a clade along with a third species from the Eastern Guiana Shield, which is also described herein. The reproductive biology of A. baeobatrachus and A. stepheni is very similar. Both species have endotrophic and nidicolous tadpoles, despite being distantly related, suggesting independent evolution of this breeding mode.

Ameerega shihuemoy sp. nov. is supported by a unique combination of characters: black dorsum with cream to light orange dorsolateral lines, blue belly reticulated with black, and the lack of axillary, thigh and calf flash marks. Within Ameerega, it shares the general appearance of A. altamazonica, A. boliviana, A. hahneli, A. ignipedis, A. petersi, A. picta, A. pongoensis, A. pulchripecta, A. simulans, A. smaragdina, and A. yungicola; each possessing a granular black to brown dorsum, a light labial bar, a conspicuous dorsolateral line running from the snout to the groin, and a metallic blue belly and underside of arms and hind limbs. From most of these species it can be distinguished by lacking flash marks on the axillae, thighs, and calves (absent in only A. boliviana and A. smaragdina, most A. petersi, and some A. pongoensis), by having bright cream to orange dorsolateral stripes (white, intense yellow, or green in all other species, with the exception of A. picta), and by its blue belly reticulated with black (bluish white and black in A. boliviana, green and blue with black marbling in A. petersi, and green and blue lacking black marbling in A. smaragdina). Its mating call also shows clear differences to morphologically similar species, with a lower note repetition rate, longer space between calls, and higher fundamental and dominant frequencies. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S mitochondrial {rRNA} fragment also support the distinctiveness of the new species and suggest that A. shihuemoy is most closely related to Ameerega macero, A. altamazonica, A. rubriventris, and two undescribed species (Ameerega sp. from Porto Walter, Acre, Brazil, and Ameerega sp. from Ivochote, Cusco, Peru). Genetically, the new species is most similar to the sympatric A. macero, from which it clearly differs in characteristics of its advertisement call and coloration. The new species is found near rocky streams during the dry season and near temporary water bodies during the rainy season. Tadpoles are found in lentic water along streams, or in shallow, slow-moving streams. Given its small geographic range, we recommend that A. shihuemoy should be considered 'Near threatened' ({NT}) according to {IUCN} Red List criteria.},

Most poison frog species (Family Dendrobatidae) exhibit male uniparental care, but ﬂexible compensation has been observed in some species, where females will take over parental care duties when males disappear. We investigated hormonal and neural correlates of sex-typical and sex-reversed parental care in a typically male uniparental species, the Dyeing Poison Frog (Dendrobates tinctorius). We ﬁrst characterized hormone levels and whole brain gene expression across parental care stages during sex-typical care. Surprisingly, hormonal changes and brain gene expression diﬀerences associated with active parental behavior in males were mirrored in their non-caregiving female partners. To further explore the disconnect between neuroendocrine patterns and behavior, we characterized hormone levels and neural activity patterns in females performing sexreversed parental care. In contrast to hormone and gene expression patterns, we found that patterns of neural activity were linked to the active performance of parental behavior, with sex-reversed tadpole transporting females exhibiting neural activity patterns more similar to those of transporting males than non-caregiving females. We suggest that parallels in hormones and brain gene expression in active and observing parents are related to females' ability to ﬂexibly take over parental care in the absence of their male partners.},

Known quantities of the steroids 5 -dihydrotestosterone ({DHT}), testosterone, 17 -estradiol, corticosterone, and the indoleamine melatonin were added to a stripped pool of chicken plasma. Samples were either immediately frozen at ¡40 °C, or treated with pure ethanol. Ethanol-treated samples were either immediately frozen, or—to simulate storage conditions at various Weld locations—left sitting at room temperature for one to two months, or incubated at 36 °C for one month before all treatment groups were frozen at ¡40 °C. All samples were then analyzed by radioimmunoassay. For {DHT} and estradiol there were no {diVerences} among treatment groups suggesting that ethanol-treatment is as {eVective} as immediate freezing in preserving plasma steroid concentrations. For testosterone, corticosterone and melatonin ethanol-treated samples {diVered} {signiWcantly} from immediately frozen samples suggesting that caution is needed when comparing absolute concentrations of hormones between samples preserved in {diVerent} ways.

	abstract = {Unlike in terrestrial animals, the boundary between internal (e.g., hormones) and external (e.g., social) stimulation can be blurred for aquatic and amphibious species. When chemicals such as hormones and glandular secretions leach into the water, they can further interact with other signaling systems, creating multimodal stimuli. It is unclear, however, whether water-borne chemical secretions from courting male frogs affect the physiology and behavior of their rivals. In order to address this question we first established non-invasive, continuous sampling methods for simultaneously measuring both hormones and behavior in amphibious species. Then, we examined whether interactions between water-borne chemical secretions and conspecific calls affect reproductive behavior and physiology (testosterone and corticosterone) of courting male túngara frogs. Our results demonstrate that conspecific acoustic stimulation alone increases locomotor activity, decreases latency to call, and increases calling behavior but does not alter the amount of hormones excreted. In response to water containing chemical secretions from rivals, but in the absence of calls from other males, males excrete more testosterone. Interestingly, the combined acoustic and chemical stimulus causes a multiplicative increase in both calling behavior and hormonal excretion. Taken together, our results suggest that a multimodal chemicalacoustic stimulus physiologically primes males for aggressive behavior.},

We additionally used an experimental approach, which consisted of broadcasting recorded advertisement calls for 10min to simulate an invasion in the territory of the focal subjects, followed by behavioral observation and blood sampling for hormonal radioimmunoassay. Results showed a pattern of co-variation between {CORT} and T across the breeding season. Furthermore, individual variation in {CORT} and T was related to different aspects of behavior: individuals with higher {CORT} showed higher calling rates, and individuals with higher steroid levels, mainly T, showed higher responsivity to social stimulation by other males in the chorus. Experimental simulation of territorial intrusion by using playback of advertisement calls of this species did not elicit consistent changes in agonistic behavior and {CORT}, but decreased T in focal males.},

In an attempt to deal with concerns about collinearity, a number of researchers orthogonalize predictor variables by residualizing (i.e., by regressing one predictor onto another, and using the residuals as a stand-in for the original predictor). In the current study, the effects of residualizing predictor variables are demonstrated and discussed using ordinary least-squares regression and mixed-effects models. Some of these effects are almost certainly not what the researcher intended and are probably highly undesirable. Most importantly, what residualizing does not do is change the result for the residualized variable, which many researchers probably will ﬁnd surprising. Further, some analyses with residualized variables cannot be meaningfully interpreted. Hence, residualizing is not a useful remedy for collinearity.},

However, many correlational studies have not detected a {signiWcant} association between aggression and peripheral T levels. One reason for this inconsistency may be due to {diVerential} metabolism of T within the brain, in particular, the conversion of T to estrogen by aromatase. Thus, {diVerences} in aromatase enzyme activity, estrogen receptor expression, and related cofactors may have important {eVects} on how steroids {aVect} aggressive behavior. Hormone manipulation studies conducted in a wide variety of species indicate that estrogens modulate aggression. There is also growing evidence that social experience has important {eVects} on the production of estrogen within the brain, and some cases can not be explained by androgenic regulation of aromatase. Such changes in central aromatase activity may play an important role in determining how social experiences {aVect} the probability of whether an individual engages in aggressive behavior. Although studies have been conducted in many taxa, there has been relatively little integration between literatures examining aggression in {diVerent} species. In this review, we compare and contrast studies examining aggression in birds, mammals, and humans. By taking an integrative approach to our review, we consider mechanisms that could explain species {diVerences} in how estrogen modulates aggression.},

The rock-pool blenny, Parablennius parvicornis, provides an excellent model to study the proximate regulation of such a trade-off between territorial and parental behavior, because nest-holder males of this species display these behaviors simultaneously. A field study was carried out in which territorial nest holder males were either treated with long-lasting implants filled with 11-ketotestosterone (11-{KT}) or with control implants. Males treated with 11-{KT} showed a higher frequency of aggressive behavior, were more responsive to aggressive challenges, and were more persistent in aggressive behavior than control males. In addition, territories were larger in males treated with 11KT than in controls. We found evidence for incompatibility between defense of a large territory and high levels of parental behavior. However, contrary to expectation, 11-{KT} did not suppress parental behavior. We suggest that trade-offs between territorial and parental behavior may not be regulated by androgen hormones but may result from a time constraint in the individual’s activity budget.},

	abstract = {1. Methods to measure metabolites of steroid hormones from faeces have become very popular in wildlife conservation and ecology, because they allow gathering physiological data without the necessity to capture the animals. However, this advantage comes at costs that are particularly relevant when studying free-living animals in their natural environments. Previous methodological reviews have stressed the importance of validations to prove that real metabolites of the hormone in question are measured, but the research community has largely ignored further caveats relating to sex, diet, metabolic rate and individual differences in hormone metabolite formation. 2. Often the sexes differ in how they metabolize hormones. As a consequence, one may not be able to compare hormone metabolite concentrations between males and females of one species. 3. Diet can alter the way hormones are metabolized, and different diets can change the amount of faecal bulk. Both phenomena can result in measurement artefacts that may seriously distort the estimation of hormone metabolite concentrations. As a consequence, comparisons of hormone metabolite concentrations, for example, between seasons or populations, may become problematic. 4. Changes in ambient temperature and food availability may trigger large fluctuations in metabolic rate of free-living animals. These fluctuations may then result in major distortions of faecal hormone metabolite concentrations without any change in bioactive hormone levels. 5. Bacteria metabolize hormones in the gut. Individual differences in bacterial composition can cause differences in how hormones are decomposed. Thus, individuals may differ with regard to what kind of hormone metabolites they form and with regard to the relative composition of these hormone metabolites. As only specific metabolites are measured, differences in metabolism may distort the results. 6. In summary, non-invasive hormone research measures various end products of a hormone after its clearance from the circulation and extensive modification by bacteria. Not only does this increase random variance, it may also generate systematic noise, which may seriously distort the signal (i.e. the hormonal status of the individual) in a non-random manner. Thus, we still need to learn much more about whether this widely used technique reliably measures the physiological status of animals in uncontrolled environments.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic disturbances have been implicated in the rapid decline of amphibians. Disturbances, such as disease and poor water quality, might cause changes in the physiology of amphibians resulting in chronic stress, which can result in decreased growth and development as well as immunosuppression. In amphibians, corticosterone ({CORT}) is the main hormone released in response to stressors. We took the ﬁrst steps towards validating a new, non-invasive, technique to assay {CORT} in amphibians using a water-borne collection method previously used only with ﬁsh. In validation of this technique, we found a signiﬁcant positive correlation between release rates of water-borne {CORT} and levels of {CORT} in circulating plasma in adults of the San Marcos salamander, Eurycea nana, and the common midwife toad, Alytes obstetricans. These results indicate that water-borne {CORT} can be used as a proxy for plasma {CORT}. Additionally, we examined basic background information on the physiological states of these two species. We found that captive-reared salamanders had signiﬁcantly lower release rates of {CORT} than ﬁeld-collected salamanders. Field-collected salamanders had signiﬁcantly higher {CORT} release rates 24 h after capture and transfer to the laboratory. For tadpoles, we found that ﬁeld-collected tadpoles did not have signiﬁcantly different {CORT} release rates than those maintained in the laboratory for four months. Our research indicates that this method of water-borne hormone collection should be viable for many species of amphibians; however, further validation via adrenocorticotropic hormone ({ACTH}) challenges is required. This method can be a useful tool for assessing the physiological state of laboratory and ﬁeld populations of amphibians and the effects of urbanization, pesticides and diseases. An important beneﬁt of this method is that it allows for repeated measures of the same individuals and can be less stressful than drawing blood.},

Numerous studies have established that testosterone could directly inﬂuence the expression of certain sexual signals. However, few of these studies have focused on the indirect role that testosterone could play in modulating prey detection and visual performance to improve the foraging ability of males and hence their acquisition of nutritional resource. In the present study, we experimentally modiﬁed the testosterone levels of European tree frog males (Hyla arborea), staying in the natural range previously measured in the ﬁeld, and we investigated the effect of testosterone on the foraging ability of individuals. Foraging capacities were measured on males placed in an arena with a virtual cricket moving on a computer screen. Our results demonstrated a signiﬁcant effect of testosterone on the hunting behavior of H. arborea. We observed that testosterone reduced the orientation latency to virtual prey for supplemented males compared to controls. In addition, testosterone significantly increased the attack promptness of male frogs. Finally, our experiment did not demonstrate any impact of testosterone on male attack success.},

	abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis ({ICHH}) assumes that testosterone plays a dual role in mediating both sexual signal expression and immunosuppression. Although there is good evidence of the {ICHH} in birds, it was primarily tested using only one sexual signal approach. By focusing on the European tree frog Hyla arborea, a species for which mate choice is based on both acoustic and visual signals, we test for the ﬁrst time the {ICHH} in a multimodal communication system. The {ICHH} may be viewed as a universal way to explain signal honesty no matter the sensory modality used by animals. After studying the effects of testosterone on the acoustic and visual sexual signals through a daily testosterone supplementation, the effects of androgen on the immune system response were measured through a phytohaemagglutinin injection. In H. arborea, we demonstrate that both the acoustic and visual sexual signals were testosterone dependent. However, the phytohaemagglutinin injection did not provoke immunosuppression for testosteronesupplemented males. Surprisingly, the testosterone-supplemented males with a high body mass presented an immunoenhancement. Therefore, it seems that {ICHH} is not an integrating mechanism that is able to explain signal honesty in the multimodal signaling system used by H. arborea in mate choice. On the contrary, our results support the idea that multiple mechanisms (e.g., cost-added and index signals) operating simultaneously may explain signal honesty of both acoustic and visual signals.},

Androgens and estrogens are critical for the expression of male and female behavior, respectively, and their effects are relatively clear. Corticosteroids have significant modulatory effects on the behavior of both sexes, as does the peptide neuromodulator arginine vasotocin in males, but their effects and interactions with gonadal steroids are often complex and difficult to understand. Recent work has shown that the gonadal hormones and social behavior are mutually reinforcing: engaging in social interactions increases hormone levels just as increasing hormone levels change behavior. The reciprocal interactions of hormones and behavior, as well as the complex interactions among gonadal steroids, adrenal steroids, and peptide hormones have implications for the maintenance and evolution of natural social behavior, and suggest that a deeper understanding of both endocrine mechanisms and social behavior would arise from field studies or other approaches that combine behavioral endocrinology with behavioral ecology.},

For this method, containment‐water is assayed for hormones released by the animal. Originally developed in fish, the method has expanded to amphibians, but requires additional species‐specific validations. We wanted to determine physiological relevance of water‐borne corticosterone in spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) by comparing concentrations to those taken using established corticosterone sampling methods, such as plasma. Using a mixture of field and laboratory studies, we compared water‐borne corticosterone levels to other traditional methods of sampling corticosterone for spotted salamander larvae, metamorphs, and adults. Despite multiple attempts, and detecting differences between age groups, we found no correlations between water‐borne and plasma corticosterone levels in any age group. Water‐borne sampling measures a rate of release; whereas plasma is the concentration circulating in the blood. The unique units of measurement may inherently prevent correlations between the two. These two methods may also require different interpretations of the data and the physiological meaning. We also note caveats with the method, including how to account for differences in body size and life history stages. Collectively, our results illustrate the importance of careful validation of water‐borne hormone levels in each species in order to understand its physiological significance.},

	abstract = {Although androgens are commonly seen as male sex hormones, it has been established over the years that in both sexes, androgens also respond to social challenges. To explain the socially driven changes in androgens, two theoretical models have been proposed: the biosocial model and the challenge hypothesis. These models are typically seen as partly overlapping; however, they generate different predictions that are clarified here. In humans, sports competition and nonmetabolic competitive tasks have been used in the laboratory setting, as a proxy for agonistic interactions in animals. The results reviewed here show that the testosterone (T) response to competition in humans is highly variable – the studies present postcompetition T levels and changes in T that depend on the contest outcome and that cannot be predicted by the current theoretical models. These conflicting results bring to the foreground the importance of considering cognitive factors that could moderate the androgen response to competition. Among these variables, we elect cognitive appraisal and its components as a key candidate modulating factor. It is known that T also modulates the cognitive processes that are relevant to performance in competition. In this article, we reviewed the evidence arising from studies investigating the effect of administering exogenous T and compare those results with the findings from studies that measured endogenous T levels. Finally, we summarized the importance of also considering the interaction between androgens and other hormones, such as cortisol, when investigating the social modulation of T, as proposed by the dual-hormone hypothesis.},

Understanding the complex relationship between hormones, behavior and their function in communication requires the simultaneous examination of multiple circulating hormones. However, repeated blood sampling within a short time period is not possible in smaller animals without impacting the very behaviors under investigation. The non-invasive technique of collecting and measuring hormone values in holding water using either radioimmunoassay ({RIA}) or enzyme immunoassay ({EIA}) is becoming widely used in teleost research. Commercial assay kits in particular enable rapid and reliable data generation, yet their assay buffers are often speciﬁc and potentially incompatible with each other, which can hinder measuring multiple hormones from the same sample. We present here the validation and application of a ‘‘nested” elution technique we developed that allows for repeated sampling of multiple reproductive hormones – testosterone (T), 17b-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), prostaglandin F2a ({PGF}) and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) – from individual samples of animal holding water by using commercial {EIA} systems. Our results show that when using appropriate controls to account for possible technical and biological confounds, this technique provides a powerful new tool for research in aquatic endocrinology and physiology.},

The Challenge Hypothesis (Wingfield, J.C., Hegner, R.E., Dufty, A.M., Ball, G.F., 1990. The “Challenge Hypothesis”: Theoretical implications for patterns of testosterone secretion, mating systems, and breeding strategies. Am. Nat. 136, 829-846) predicts that seasonal patterns in androgen levels vary as a function of mating system, male–male aggression and paternal care. Although many studies have addressed these predictions, investigators have often assumed that the ratio of the breeding season maximum and breeding baseline concentrations (termed “androgen responsiveness”) reflects hormonal responses due to social stimulation. However, increasing evidence suggests that seasonal androgen elevations are not necessarily caused by social interactions between males. Here, we separate the seasonal androgen response (Rseasonal) and the androgen responsiveness to male–male competition (Rmale–male) to begin to distinguish between different kinds of hormonal responses. We demonstrate that Rseasonal and Rmale–male are fundamentally different and should be treated as separate variables. Differences are particularly evident in single-brooded male birds that show no increase in plasma androgen levels during simulated territorial intrusions ({STIs}), even though Rseasonal is elevated. In multiple-brooded species, {STIs} typically elicit a rise in androgens. We relate these findings to the natural history of single- and multiple-brooded species and suggest a research approach that could be utilized to increase our understanding of the factors that determine different types of androgen responses. This approach does not only include Rseasonal and Rmale–male, but also the androgen responsiveness to receptive females (Rmale–female) and to non-social environmental cues (Renvironmental), as well as the physiological capacity to produce and secrete androgens (Rpotential). Through such studies, we can begin to better understand how social and environmental factors may lead to differences in androgen responses.},

We examined three steroid hormones (corticosterone, {CORT}; 17-b estradiol, E2; progesterone, {PROG}) in túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) using non-invasive water-borne methods. Using solid-phase extraction of water samples and liquid extraction of plasma and homogenate samples, coupled with enzyme immunoassays, we complimented the conventional validation approaches (parallelism, recovery determination) with dose-response assays that incorporated pharmacological challenges with adrenocorticotropic hormone ({ACTH}) and human chorionic gonadotropin ({HCG}). We also compared steroid concentrations in water to those observed in plasma and whole body homogenates. Lastly, we identiﬁed the constituent steroids in each sample type with a panel targeting 30 steroid species using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ({HPLC}-{MS}). We found that a 60-min water-bath captures physiologically relevant changes in concentrations of {CORT}, E2 and {PROG}. Peak levels of water-borne {CORT} were found at approximately 2 h after {ACTH} injection. Water-borne {CORT} and E2 concentrations were positively correlated with their plasma and homogenate equivalents, while water-borne {PROG} was uncorrelated with homogenate {PROG} concentrations but negatively correlated with homogenate E2 concentrations. Together, our ﬁndings indicate that sampling water-borne hormones presents a non-invasive and biologically informative approach that will be useful for behavioral endocrinologists and conservation physiologists.},

	abstract = {In many vertebrates testosterone increases during aggressive interactions and the surges in this hormone may be responsible for the winner effect. So far studies on this relationship have been done in captivity only, because simulating a winning situation for a territory owner in the ﬁeld is difﬁcult. However, an increasing number of studies show that territorial aggression is not necessarily accompanied by elevated testosterone after a single simulated territorial intrusion ({STI}) and therefore it has been proposed that {STIs} may even create a losing experience. We examined whether free-living male black redstarts (Phoenicurus ochruros) show changes in androgens, corticosterone and behavior following repeated {STIs} of high or low intensity and in contrast to being challenged only once. Repeated intrusions had no inﬂuence on androgen and corticosterone levels regardless of intrusion intensity. In contrast, the behavioral response changed over days depending on the intensity of the intrusion. Only birds challenged with high-level intruders approached the decoy signiﬁcantly faster during the third intrusion than during the ﬁrst one, stayed closer to the decoy, and sang more songs than males challenged with low-level intruders. Thus, although black redstarts reacted differently to {STIs} varying in frequency and intensity, these behavioral differences were not reﬂected in androgen or corticosterone levels. Our data show that it is unlikely that {STIs} induce a losing experience. Furthermore, they indicate that a hormonal effect of winning an encounter may not be universal in vertebrates and may depend on the ecological or life-history context.},

	abstract = {In this paper I discuss how the challenge hypothesis (Wingﬁeld et al., 1990) inﬂuenced the development of ideas about animal personality, and describe particularly promising areas for future study at the intersection of these two topics. I argue that the challenge hypothesis inﬂuenced the study of animal personality in at least three speciﬁc ways. First, the challenge hypothesis drew attention to the ways in which the environment experienced by an organism – including the social environment – can inﬂuence biological processes internal to the organism, e.g. changes to physiology, gene expression, neuroendocrine state and epigenetic modiﬁcations. That is, the challenge hypothesis illustrated the bidirectional, dynamic relationship between hormones and (social) environments, thereby helping us to understand how behavioral variation among individuals can emerge over time. Because the paper was inspired by data collected on free living animals in natural populations, it drew behavioral ecologists' attention to this phenomenon. Second, the challenge hypothesis highlighted what became a paradigmatic example of a hormonal mechanism for a behavioral spillover, i.e. testosterone's pleiotropic eﬀects on both territorial aggression and parental care causes aggression to “spillover” to inﬂuence parenting behavior, thereby limiting behavioral plasticity. Third, the challenge hypothesis contributed to what is now a cottage industry examining individual diﬀerences in hormone titres and their relationship with behavioral variation. I argue that one particularly promising future research direction in this area is to consider the active role of behavior and behavioral types in eliciting social interactions, including territorial challenges.},

	abstract = {According to the Challenge Hypothesis, social interactions, particularly among males, have a strong inﬂuence on circulating androgen levels. Speciﬁcally, males should respond to social challenges from conspeciﬁc males with a rapid increase in plasma androgen levels which support and stimulate further aggression. This basic tenet of the Challenge Hypothesis, an androgen increase in response to a social challenge from another male, has been tested in all vertebrate classes. While early studies generally supported the Challenge Hypothesis, more recent work has noted numerous exceptions, particularly in birds. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis of studies in ﬁsh, amphibians, non-avian reptiles, and mammals that test the prediction that circulating androgen levels of males should increase in response to an experimental challenge from another male. We found that teleost ﬁsh often increase androgens during such challenges, but other vertebrate groups show more mixed results. Why should ﬁsh be diﬀerent from the other taxa? In ﬁsh with paternal care of young, the potential conﬂict between mating, being aggressive towards other males, and taking care of oﬀspring is alleviated, because females typically choose males based on their defense of an already existing nest. Hence, rather than regulating the trade-oﬀ between mating, aggression, and parenting, androgens may have been co-opted to promote all three behaviors. For other taxa, increasing androgen levels only makes sense when the increase directly enhances reproductive success. Thus, the increase in androgen levels is a response to mating opportunities rather than a response to challenge from another male. To further our understanding of the role of a change in androgen levels in mediating behavioral decision-making between mating, aggression, and parenting, we need studies that address the behavioral consequences of an increase in androgens after male-male encounters and studies that test the androgen responsiveness of species that diﬀer in the degree of paternal care.},

	abstract = {Exhibiting behavioral plasticity in order to mount appropriate responses to dynamic and novel social environments is crucial to the survival of all animals. Thus, how animals regulate ﬂexibility in the timing, duration, and intensity of speciﬁc behaviors is of great interest to biologists. In this review, we discuss how animals rapidly respond to social challenges, with a particular focus on aggression. We utilize a conceptual framework to understand the neural mechanisms of aggression that is grounded in Wingﬁeld and colleagues' Challenge Hypothesis, which has profoundly inﬂuenced how scientists think about aggression and the mechanisms that allow animals to exhibit ﬂexible responses to social instability. Because aggressive behavior is rooted in social interactions, we propose that mechanisms modulating prosocial behavior may be intricately tied to mechanisms of aggression. Therefore, in order to better understand how aggressive behavior is mediated, we draw on perspectives from social neuroscience and discuss how social context, species-typical behavioral phenotype, and neural systems commonly studied in relation to prosocial behavior (i.e., neuropeptides) contribute to organizing rapid responses to social challenges. Because complex behaviors are not the result of one mechanism or a single neural system, we consider how multiple neural systems important for prosocial and aggressive behavior (i.e., neuropeptides and neurosteroids) interact in the brain to produce behavior in a rapid, context-appropriate manner. Applying a systems neuroscience perspective and seeking to understand how multiple systems functionally integrate to rapidly modulate behavior holds great promise for expanding our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying social behavioral plasticity.},

Here, we used natural recordings to determine the associations between stream noise and call parameters in the little torrent frog (Amolops torrentis). We also used playbacks of stream noise recorded in natural habitats and playbacks of white noise to examine how male vocal signals change with increasing noise levels. The results show that noise intensity has a significant effect on male call frequency, but not on call amplitude or other call characteristics. Based on this evidence, we suggest that in streamside species stream noise drives males to alter call frequency and call as loudly as possible in order to improve discriminability. These findings provide insights into the role played by ecological selection in the evolution of noise‐dependent anuran vocal plasticity.},

Because traps that broadcast simulated calling songs at {\textgreater}90 {dB} catch enormous numbers of mole crickets, the upper limit of greater phonotaxis to higher sound levels is important to sound trap design. In three series of tests of traps broadcasting synthetic calling songs differing by 12 {dB}, the louder trap captured 3 to 9 times as many mole crickets as the quieter one. The effect was significantly greater in trials of 94 vs 106 {dB} and of 106 vs 118 {dB} than in trials of 116 vs 128 {dB}, but we failed to find the upper limit we were seeking.

	abstract = {Prolonged and complex courtship behaviors, involving tactile, acoustic, and visual signals, are common in Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). Courtship is an important precursor to mating, but courtship components vary across species. In Brilliant-Thighed Poison Frogs (Allobates femoralis [Boulenger 1883]), males guide females to oviposition sites in a so-called “courtship march.” The courtship duration in A. femoralis is among the longest known in poison frogs. To gain insights into the functions of courtship, we observed 29 courtship events in an A. femoralis population in French Guiana. In addition, we observed multiple courtships of 7 males to assess intra- and interindividual variations in courtship behavior. We recorded temporal, spatial, and behavioral characteristics of courtship and searched for previously deposited clutches in the males' territories. Courtships started in the afternoon and ended on the following morning. During courtship, pairs moved an average of 19 m within an area of about 6 m2. Twenty-seven out of 29 courtships (93.1\%) resulted in successful oviposition, indicating that females rarely reject males once engaged in courtship. Contrary to previous studies of A. femoralis, the spatial and temporal extent of the courtship march did not correlate with the size of a male's territory. Our results indicate that females do not evaluate male quality during courtship but might need an extended courtship phase to verify territory ownership of the courting male and to stimulate ovulation. The prolonged courtship might also be beneficial for spatial learning by females, allowing them to find clutches again in cases of mate loss. Temporal and spatial characteristics vary considerably within and among individuals, and males do not use the same routes in consecutive courtships. However, they probably show females previous clutches. Several courtship traits in our study population differ from A. femoralis courtship previously described from Peru and Brazil, indicating that dendrobatid courtship is variable among populations.},

Calls were recorded at distances of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 m. We varied speaker and microphone heights for a total of five elevation combinations ranging from surface level to a height of 1.5 m. We quantified structural degradation in recorded calls using {BΔV},{\textasciicircum} a measure of relative sound energy in call pulses and interpulse intervals. A subset of recorded calls was used in two-speaker discrimination tests with females. Finally, we examined male selection of perch height by recording locations of calling males on ladder-like trellises positioned around the periphery of a breeding pond. We found the greatest degradation for calls broadcast through forest followed by calls transmitted across open terrain and then pond water. At relatively small source-receiver separations, elevation had only small effects on degradation. However, for separations greater than 4 m (especially through forest), elevation had a significant impact on ΔV—with calls broadcast and recorded near the substrate particularly vulnerable to degradation. Choice tests demonstrated that such levels of degradation could significantly reduce a male’s attractiveness. This may, in part, explain why males only seldom called from low rungs of trellises.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/4534546},
	abstract = {In this study the effects of bird size, genus, habitat, song community and geographical distribution on song structure and singing behaviour of some passerine species in northern Europe were simultaneously studied. Most species tend to improve their long distance song propagation in their specific habitat and song community. Song propagation correlates strongest with the use of low-pitched elements but not all birds are able to use these because of size limitation. In forest habitats whistles and modulated elements were used to improve song propagation. In open habitats high-pitched elements as well as repeated and trilled syllables were often used for better propagation of acoustic information. In song communities with a great number of species, the birds reduce song interference by other singers, by singing short songs and using modulated elements and long intersong pauses. When the birds greatly profit from effective long distance song propagation, like in northern areas with only short time for pair formation, the birds can segregate in singing time by using the light nights for singing. In these communities with low numbers of species the birds have been freed from song interference and have long songs and short intersong pauses and they can increase in this way their singing rate. The effect of song community on song length, intersong pause and the use of modulated elements in the song is stronger than that of habitat. The effect of the song community increases towards the north. /// Nous avons étudié simultanément les effets de la taille des oiseaux, du genre, de l'habitat, de la communauté de chant et de la distribution géographique, sur la structure du chant et sur le comportement de chant, chez différentes espèces du Nord de l'Europe. La plupart des espèces étudiées tendent à améliorer la communication acoustique à longue distance, chacune dans son habitat spécifique. La diffusion du chant est fortement corrélée avec l'utilisation d'éléments à basse tonalité; mais toutes les espèces ne peuvent les utiliser, car les tonalités graves ont une corrélation nette avec la taille de l'oiseau. Dans des habitats forestiers, sifflements et éléments modulés sont utilisés pour améliorer la diffusion du chant. Sur les habitats découverts, les éléments de tonalité aiguë et les syllables répétées et trillées sont souvent utilisés pour une meilleure propagation de l'information acoustique. Dans les communautés formées d'un grand nombre d'espèces différentes, les oiseaux réduisent les interférences avec d'autres chanteurs en produisant des chants courts, en faisant des pauses longues entre les chants, et en utilisant des éléments modulés. Quand les oiseaux ont intérêt à une diffusion efficace des chants à longue distance (comme c'est le cas dans des régions septentrionales où ils n'ont que peu de temps pour la formation des couples), ils réalisent entre eux une ségrégation bien nette pour l'heure des chants, en profitant des longues nuits claires. Dans les communautés où le nombre d'espèces est restreint, les oiseaux ne sont pas dérangés par ces interférences; ils ont des chants plus longs et des pauses plus courtes, de sorte qu'ils augmentent leur quantité de chant. L'effet de la communauté de chant sur la longueur des chants, la longueur des pauses entre les chants, l'utilisation d'éléments modulés, est bien plus fort que l'effet de l'habitat. Cet effet de la communauté de chant augmente progressivement en allant vers le Nord.},

This raises the question of why organisms differ in their tolerance to environmental alterations. Here, we ask whether and how behavioural adjustments assist animals in dealing with the urbanization process, one of the primary causes of biodiversity loss and biotic homogenization. Based on a literature review, we present both theoretical and empirical arguments to show that behavioural adjustments to urban habitats are widespread and that they may potentially be important in facilitating resource use, avoiding disturbances and enhancing communication. While a growing number of studies report behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals, very few studies directly address the underlying mechanisms. In some cases, the changes in behaviour occur very rapidly and involve learning, and hence can be attributed to behavioural plasticity. In other cases, however, it cannot be ruled out that behavioural differences between urban and nonurban animals result from natural selection or nonrandom sorting of individuals by behavioural traits that affect dispersal, habitat selection or establishment. Because the urbanization process is expected to continue to threaten biodiversity in the near future, there is some urgency to improve our understanding of the mechanisms through which behaviour helps animals to cope with such environmental alterations.},

Birds and mammals increase call intensity or frequency as noise levels increase, but it is unclear to what extend this behavior is shared by frogs. Concave-eared torrent frogs (Odorrana tormota) have evolved the capacity to produce various calls containing ultrasonic harmonics and to communicate beside noisy streams. However, it is largely unclear how frogs regulate vocalization in response to increasing noise levels. We exposed male frogs to various levels of noise with playback of conspecific female courtship calls and recorded antiphonal signals and spontaneous short calls. Males were capable of rapidly adjusting fundamental frequency and amplitude of antiphonal signals as noise levels increased. The increment in fundamental frequency and amplitude was approximately 0.5 {kHz} and 3 {dB} with every 10 {dB} increase in noise level, indicating the presence of noise-dependent signal characteristics. Males showed the noise-tolerant adaption in response to female calls in noise level from 40 to 90 {dB} {SPL}. The results suggest that the noise-dependent signal characteristics in O. tormota have evolved as a strategy to cope with varying torrent noise.},

Predation rates on brown models were almost twice that of red models, suggesting that predators avoid brightly colored frog models. Birds accounted for the majority of attacks on the models.

	abstract = {Many animals use acoustic signals as a means of intra- and inter-specific communication. For example, male anuran amphibians produce advertisement calls to attract females for breeding, and as a territorial signal. The production of acoustic signals can be energetically costly, and the distance over which a signal is effective depends on a range of variables including the location of the caller and receiver, ambient conditions and the habitat through which the sound travels. This paper presents a spatially explicit model of the propagation of an anuran advertisement call across a landscape, using the example of the northern spring peeper Pseudacris crucifer crucifer. The model is used to investigate (a) the effect of habitat, caller position and chorus noise on the effective distance of a call with a frequency of approximately 3 {kHz}; and (b) the energetics and efficiency of calling at different intensities and from different locations in the landscape. Calling next to still water or from an elevated perch increases, while calling in a chorus decreases, the distance over which a female can distinguish an individual male's call. For a given call intensity and calling rate, a male spring peeper will get the greatest “bang for its energetic buck” if it calls next to still water in the absence of chorus noise. However, when a chorus of spring peepers is gathered at a pond, calling from an elevated position away from the pond (and the chorus noise) will maximise the effective distance of an individual call, although this may entail other costs. The model presented here is the first realistic, interactive mathematical model of the propagation of animal sounds across a landscape, and uses a gis interface to display the effect of habitat and caller position on animal communication.

	abstract = {Sound pressure level ({SPL}) has received little attention as a distance cue or signal for communication because of the methodological difficulty of determining source {SPL} from free-ranging signallers and because {SPL} is presumed to be unreliable as a distance cue. Eastern towhees, Pipilo erythrophthalmus (Emberizidae, Passeriformes), in south-central Florida give a simple call during territorial interactions. I obtained measurements of call-source {SPL} with a calibrated microphone positioned 100±10cm from caged male eastern towhees. Measurements of source {SPL} were highly variable, but much of this variation can be predicted from measurements of call duration or call frequency variables (spectrotemporal variables). Male towhees accurately perceived the distance of a speaker after it played synthetic calls that matched the amplitude and structure of natural 84-{dB} and 78-{dB} call types. Subjects flew further in response to an attenuated (−6 or −12dB) version of an otherwise identical 84-{dB} call and flew shorter in response to an amplified (+6dB) version of this same call. Towhees misjudged speaker distance in approximately half of the trials that included a discrepancy (−6, −12 or +6dB {SPL}) between playback source {SPL} and predicted spectrotemporal variables. These distance errors suggest that towhees assess auditory distance partly from the difference between perceived {SPL} and source {SPL}, determined from spectrotemporal variables.},

Among vertebrate signals, it is becoming clear that no single stereotyped signal feature reliably elicits species-specific behavior, but rather, that a suite of characters is involved. Within the largely nocturnal clade of anuran amphibians, the dart-poison frog, Epipedobates femoralis, is a diurnal species that physically and vigorously defends its calling territory against conspecific intruders. Here we report that physical attacks by a territorial male are provoked only in response to dynamic bimodal stimuli in which the acoustic playback of vocalizations is coupled with vocal sac pulsations, but not by either unimodal cues presented in isolation or static bimodal stimuli. These results suggest that integration of dynamic bimodal cues is necessary to elicit aggression in this species.},

	abstract = {Repeatability (more precisely the common measure of repeatability, the intra-class correlation coefficient, {ICC}) is an important index for quantifying the accuracy of measurements and the constancy of phenotypes. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation that can be attributed to between-subject (or between-group) variation. As a consequence, the non-repeatable fraction of phenotypic variation is the sum of measurement error and phenotypic flexibility. There are several ways to estimate repeatability for Gaussian data, but there are no formal agreements on how repeatability should be calculated for non-Gaussian data (e.g. binary, proportion and count data). In addition to point estimates, appropriate uncertainty estimates (standard errors and confidence intervals) and statistical significance for repeatability estimates are required regardless of the types of data. We review the methods for calculating repeatability and the associated statistics for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data. For Gaussian data, we present three common approaches for estimating repeatability: correlation-based, analysis of variance ({ANOVA})-based and linear mixed-effects model ({LMM})-based methods, while for non-Gaussian data, we focus on generalised linear mixed-effects models ({GLMM}) that allow the estimation of repeatability on the original and on the underlying latent scale. We also address a number of methods for calculating standard errors, confidence intervals and statistical significance; the most accurate and recommended methods are parametric bootstrapping, randomisation tests and Bayesian approaches. We advocate the use of {LMM}- and {GLMM}-based approaches mainly because of the ease with which confounding variables can be controlled for. Furthermore, we compare two types of repeatability (ordinary repeatability and extrapolated repeatability) in relation to narrow-sense heritability. This review serves as a collection of guidelines and recommendations for biologists to calculate repeatability and heritability from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian data.},

	abstract = {Songbirds are well known to use the degradation of conspecific song to assess the distance of the singer (called ranging). Because a song's degradation accumulates progressively with propagation distance and thus is not under direct control of the singer, it potentially provides more reliable distance information than the amplitude of songs. However, song amplitude decreases progressively with distance and thus also provides information about the singer's distance, provided that interference from wind is low and that the sender does not alter broadcast volume. This study investigated whether or not Carolina wrens, Thryothorus ludovicianus, can use changes in amplitude of conspecific song as a relative cue for ranging. Twelve male subjects each received one playback consisting of two successive songs differing by 6 {dB} in amplitude. Half the subjects received playbacks with the louder song first and the other half received playbacks with the louder song second. Receivers that would use song amplitude for ranging would perceive the simulated rival either as approaching or retreating, depending on whether the louder song was played first or second. Subjects responded as if the rival was farther away in the simulated retreat than in the simulated approach, indicating that Carolina wrens can use differences in amplitude of successive songs for ranging. Apparently, the risk of inaccurate ranging by song amplitude is outweighed by the advantage of using multiple cues, including information from song amplitude, to assess a rival's distance.},

	abstract = {One strategy for coping with the constraints on acoustic signal reception posed by ambient noise is to signal louder as noise levels increase. Termed the ‘Lombard effect’, this reflexive behaviour is widespread among birds and mammals and occurs with a diversity of signal types, leading to the hypothesis that voice amplitude regulation represents a general vertebrate mechanism for coping with environmental noise. Support for this evolutionary hypothesis, however, remains limited due to a lack of studies in taxa other than birds and mammals. Here, we report the results of an experimental test of the hypothesis that male grey treefrogs increase the amplitude of their advertisement calls in response to increasing levels of chorus-shaped noise. We recorded spontaneously produced calls in quiet and in the presence of noise broadcast at sound pressure levels ranging between 40 {dB} and 70 {dB}. While increasing noise levels induced predictable changes in call duration and rate, males did not regulate call amplitude. These results do not support the hypothesis that voice amplitude regulation is a generic vertebrate mechanism for coping with noise. We discuss the possibility that intense sexual selection and high levels of competition for mates in choruses place some frogs under strong selection to call consistently as loudly as possible.},

Significance testing based on p-values is standard in psychological research and teaching. Typically, research articles and textbooks present and use p as a measure of statistical evidence against the null hypothesis (the Fisherian interpretation), although using concepts and tools based on a completely different usage of p as a tool for controlling long-term decision errors (the Neyman–Pearson interpretation). There are four major problems with using p as a measure of evidence and these problems are often overlooked in the domain of psychology. First, p is uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis and can therefore never indicate evidence for the null. Second, p is conditioned solely on the null hypothesis and is therefore unsuited to quantify evidence, because evidence is always relative in the sense of being evidence for or against a hypothesis relative to another hypothesis. Third, p designates probability of obtaining evidence (given the null), rather than strength of evidence. Fourth, p depends on unobserved data and subjective intentions and therefore implies, given the evidential interpretation, that the evidential strength of observed data depends on things that did not happen and subjective intentions. In sum, using p in the Fisherian sense as a measure of statistical evidence is deeply problematic, both statistically and conceptually, while the Neyman–Pearson interpretation is not about evidence at all. In contrast, the likelihood ratio escapes the above problems and is recommended as a tool for psychologists to represent the statistical evidence conveyed by obtained data relative to two hypotheses.},

Given the benefits of singing loudly with regard to signal transmission in the context of territory defence and mate attraction, we investigated whether songbirds adjust the sound level of their territorial songs depending on social influences. While interacting with the playback of a simulated conspecific rival, seven male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, increased the sound level of their songs, on average, by more than 5 {dB}. The nightingales increased their song level to significantly lower values (about 1 {dB}) in response to control songs of other species, so the revealed increase in vocal intensity during interactions cannot be fully explained by the acoustical masking of the interfering conspecific songs. Thus, the birds improved signal transmission to a higher degree during conspecific male–male interactions.},

	abstract = {Some animals that use sound to communicate compensate for interference from background noise by adjusting the amplitude of their vocalizations as environmental noise levels vary. Territorial songbirds may have evolved a different strategy, since they can be expected to benefit from maximizing the amplitude of their songs to defend territories and attract females. We tested this hypothesis with calibrated measurements of the song level of male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos. All birds increased the sound level of their songs in response to an increase in white noise broadcast to them. A second experiment revealed that noise in the spectral region of their own songs was most effective in inducing the birds to increase vocal intensity. These findings show that nightingales do not maximize song amplitude but regulate vocal intensity dependent on the level of masking noise. The adjustment of vocal amplitude may serve to maintain a specific signal-to-noise ratio that is favourable for signal production. Concurrently, increasing the intensity of songs can maintain a given active space for communication. Thus, vocal amplitude in a territorial songbird can be interpreted as a flexible trait, which is individually regulated according to ecological demands from signal transmission.

	abstract = {Circular Statistics in R provides the most comprehensive guide to the analysis of circular data in over a decade. Circular data arise in many scientific contexts whether it be angular directions such as: observed compass directions of departure of radio-collared migratory birds from a release point; bond angles measured in different molecules; wind directions at different times of year at a wind farm; direction of stress-fractures in concrete bridge supports; longitudes of earthquake epicentres or seasonal and daily activity patterns, for example: data on the times of day at which animals are caught in a camera trap, or in 911 calls in New York, or in internet traffic; variation throughout the year in measles incidence, global energy requirements, {TV} viewing figures or injuries to athletes. The natural way of representing such data graphically is as points located around the circumference of a circle, hence their name. Importantly, circular variables are periodic in nature and the origin, or zero point, such as the beginning of a new year, is defined arbitrarily rather than necessarily emerging naturally from the system. This book will be of value both to those new to circular data analysis as well as those more familiar with the field. For beginners, the authors start by considering the fundamental graphical and numerical summaries used to represent circular data before introducing distributions that might be used to model them. They go on to discuss basic forms of inference such as point and interval estimation, as well as formal significance tests for hypotheses that will often be of scientific interest. When discussing model fitting, the authors advocate reduced reliance on the classical von Mises distribution; showcasing distributions that are capable of modelling features such as asymmetry and varying levels of kurtosis that are often exhibited by circular data. The use of likelihood-based and computer-intensive approaches to inference and modelling are stressed throughout the book. The R programming language is used to implement the methodology, particularly its "circular" package. Also provided are over 150 new functions for techniques not already covered within R. This concise but authoritative guide is accessible to the diverse range of scientists who have circular data to analyse and want to do so as easily and as effectively as possible.},

	abstract = {Despite the impressive growth of knowledge on the phylogenetic systematics of dart-poison frogs and their relatives (Dendrobatoidea) over the past decade, many problems remain to be addressed. We analyzed up to 189 phenomic characters (morphology, behavior, defensive chemicals) and 15 mitochondrial and nuclear loci scored for 564 dendrobatoid and outgroup terminals, including 76 newly sequenced terminals and {\textgreater} 20 previously unanalyzed species, using tree-alignment and the parsimony optimality criterion in the program {POY} v.5.1.1 and additional analyses of the implied alignment using {TNT} v.1.5. Even though data coverage was highly heterogeneous, the strict consensus of 639 optimal trees is highly resolved and we detected only one instance of wildcard behavior involving a small clade of outgroup species. The monophyly of the median lingual process ({MLP}) possessing genus Anomaloglossus is decisively refuted, with the cis-Andean species being sister to Rheobates within Aromobatidae and the trans-Andean species nested within Hyloxalinae, implying two independent origins of the structure in Dendrobatoidea. Although this result was unexpected, it is not surprising given that the {MLP} evolved at least five times in Asian and African ranoids, including Arthroleptidae, Dicroglossidae, Mantellidae, and Rhacophoridae and either once in the most recent common ancestor of the massive clade Victoranura followed by independent losses or multiple times within component lineages. We restrict Anomaloglossus to the cis-Andean {MLP}-possessing species, describe a new genus for the trans-Andean {MLP}-possessing species, and resurrect Paruwrobates for its sister group, which includes Dendrobates andinus (formerly Ameerega), D. erythromos (formerly Hyloxalus and, until recently, Ameerega), and Prostherapis whymperi (formerly Hyloxalus). We also transfer Dendrobates maculatus from Ameerega to Epipedobates, making Ameerega an exclusively cis-Andean group. We describe two new species of the trans-Andean {MLP}-possessing genus—one from Cerro Tacarcuna, near the Colombo-Panamanian border, and the other from 800–900 m elevation on the western versant of the Colombian Cordillera Occidental (Cauca Department)—bringing the total number of species in the genus to seven. The discrete, round, white to yellowish-brown dots found on the venter of the new species from Cerro Tacarcuna and at least one other trans-Andean {MLP}-possessing species are formed by large, ellipsoid, densely distributed (up to 80 glands/mm2) granular glands. Although specimens of the new species from Cerro Tacarcuna exuded a noxious milky substance when handled, lipophilic alkaloids were not detected. In addition to the unexpected placement of the trans-Andean {MLP}-possessing species, major findings include the unexpected placement of Colostethus ruthveni and its undescribed sister species (the “C.” ruthveni group) within Dendrobatinae as sister of the newly recognized tribe Dendrobatini (all dendrobatines except Phyllobates and the “C.” ruthveni group). We describe a new genus for C. argyrogaster and C. fugax to remedy the paraphyly of Colostethus caused by the placement of those species as sister to Ameerega. Our evidence rejects the sister group relationship of Dendrobates Oophaga in favor of Dendrobates Adelphobates, which is consistent with their uniquely low diploid chromosome number of 2n = 18 (2n = 20 in Oophaga). With the exception of Anomaloglossus and Colostethus, all other genera are monophyletic. We recognize several monophyletic species groups—including the Atlantic Forest, trans-Andean, and 22-chromosome groups within Allobates, the An. stepheni, An. megacephalus, and An. beebei groups in Anomaloglossus, the C. latinasus (formed by the C. inguinalis and C. latinasus clades) and C. fraterdanieli groups within Colostethus, and the Am. braccata and Am. rubriventris groups within Ameerega—identify unambiguously optimized phenomic synapomorphies, and summarize patterns in the evolution},

Unmated males also sang more and used a greater proportion of singing perches in the interior of their terriories than mated males. Although unmated males used more singing perches than mated males, they used fewer in proportion to the amount of song. Both unmated and mated males frequently sang into or across their territories, although mated males sang into their territories to a greater degree. Neither class of males directed song exclusively out of their territories when singing near boundaries. Unmated males also performed more visual displays associated with singing. Mated males chased both conspecifics and heterospecifics more than did unmated males. These findings support the hypothesis that mockingbird song at this time of the breeding season functions largely in male-female interactions.},

	volume = {60},
	issn = {0014-3820},
	abstract = {The efficacy of communication relies on detection of species-specific signals against the background noise. Features affecting signal detection are thus expected to evolve under selective pressures represented by masking noise. Spectral partitioning between the auditory signals of co-occurring species has been interpreted as the outcome of the selective effects of masking interference. However, masking interference depends not only on signal's frequency but on receiver's range of frequency sensitivity; moreover, selection on signal frequency can be confounded by selection on body size, because these traits are often correlated. To know whether geographic variation in communication traits agrees with predictions about masking interference effects, we tested the hypothesis that variation in the male-male communication system of the Amazonian frog, Allobates femoralis, is correlated with the occurrence of a single species calling within an overlapping frequency range, Epipedobates trivittatus. We studied frogs at eight sites, four where both species co-occur and four where A. femoralis occurs but E. trivittatus does not. To study the sender component of the communication system of A. femoralis and to describe the use of the spectral range, we analyzed the signal's spectral features of all coactive species at each site. To study the receiver component, we derived frequency-response curves from playback experiments conducted on territorial males of A. femoralis under natural conditions. Most geographic variation in studied traits was correlated with either call frequency or with response frequency range. The occurrence of E. trivittatus significantly predicted narrower and asymmetric frequency-response curves in A. femoralis, without concomitant differences in the call or in body size. The number of acoustically coactive species did not significantly predict variation in any of the studied traits. Our results strongly support that the receiver but not the sender component of the communication system changed due to masking interference by a single species.},

	abstract = {Acoustic signaling plays key roles in mediating many of the reproductive and social behaviors of anurans (frogs and toads). Moreover, acoustic signaling often occurs at night, in structurally complex habitats, such as densely vegetated ponds, and in dense breeding choruses characterized by high levels of background noise and acoustic clutter. Fundamental to anuran behavior is the ability of the auditory system to determine accurately the location from where sounds originate in space (sound source localization) and to assign specific sounds in the complex acoustic milieu of a chorus to their correct sources (sound source segregation). Here, we review anatomical, biophysical, neurophysiological, and behavioral studies aimed at identifying how the internally coupled ears of frogs contribute to sound source localization and segregation. Our review focuses on treefrogs in the genus Hyla, as they are the most thoroughly studied frogs in terms of sound source localization and segregation. They also represent promising model systems for future work aimed at understanding better how internally coupled ears contribute to sound source localization and segregation. We conclude our review by enumerating directions for future research on these animals that will require the collaborative efforts of biologists, physicists, and roboticists.},

Generally, the species were found to be active within a {\textless}4 log-unit range of illuminance and to feed within an even narrower range. Evidence suggests that photic cues may aid in niche partitioning among species. Bufo marinus and Leptodactylus pentadactylus were active at night, the former in brighter, open places, the latter in the dimmer forest. Dendrobates auratus had bimodal diel activity periods in early morning and late evening. Bufo typhonius and Physalaemus pustulosus were active during the day, the former in the dimmer forest, the latter in brighter, open areas. Thus, activity rhythms, phototactic behavior, and habitat selection interact to allow an anuran to be active under a relatively narrow range of light levels during a day, theoretically the range within which its eyes are best adapted evolutionarily.},

	abstract = {Many animals use acoustic signals as a means of intra- and inter-specific communication. For example, male anuran amphibians produce advertisement calls to attract females for breeding, and as a territorial signal. The production of acoustic signals can be energetically costly, and the distance over which a signal is effective depends on a range of variables including the location of the caller and receiver, ambient conditions and the habitat through which the sound travels. This paper presents a spatially explicit model of the propagation of an anuran advertisement call across a landscape, using the example of the northern spring peeper Pseudacris crucifer crucifer. The model is used to investigate (a) the effect of habitat, caller position and chorus noise on the effective distance of a call with a frequency of approximately 3 {kHz}; and (b) the energetics and efficiency of calling at different intensities and from different locations in the landscape. Calling next to still water or from an elevated perch increases, while calling in a chorus decreases, the distance over which a female can distinguish an individual male's call. For a given call intensity and calling rate, a male spring peeper will get the greatest "bang for its energetic buck" if it calls next to still water in the absence of chorus noise. However, when a chorus of spring peepers is gathered at a pond, calling from an elevated position away from the pond (and the chorus noise) will maximise the effective distance of an individual call, although this may entail other costs. The model presented here is the first realistic, interactive mathematical model of the propagation of animal sounds across a landscape, and uses a {GIS} interface to display the effect of habitat and caller position on animal communication.

	abstract = {Abstract Many territorial species respond less aggressively to familiar neighbours than to unfamiliar floating strangers based on individual differences in acoustic signals. This form of social recognition, termed neighbour–stranger discrimination ({NSD}) or dear-enemy phenomenon has been reported so far from three anuran species. To investigate the potential of auditory signal features to convey information on sender's identity, we determined patterns of within-male and between-male variability in the advertisement call of the aromobatid frog Allobates femoralis. We examined 285 calls from 19 males to assess those call properties showing sufficient and reliable inter-individual differences to function as possible recognition cues. Beside calls per call bout and call rate, all other examined call properties were more variable among males than within males. Generally, temporal call features showed higher between- and within-male variability ratios than spectral properties and contributed mostly to distinguish individual males in the discriminant-function analysis. Mean classification success of 64.9\% correctly assigned calls to individual males is mainly attributable to three temporal call properties (duration of note 1 and 4, note repetition rate). Altogether, our results suggest that there is sufficient variation in the advertisement call to discriminate statistically among individual males. However, assessed call differences between A. femoralis males were rather small, suggesting that potential {NSD} might be based either on a combination of call features or even on the whole pattern of individual call variation instead on single call properties. Habituation–discrimination experiments in the field using modified playback signals to test for differential behavioural responses are required to confirm this hypothesis.},

Neighbour call amplitudes were kept within a narrow range, and relative variability in neighbour call amplitude was much, less than variability in inter-male distances.

We studied the geographic variation of the advertisement calls of male Pleurodema thaul individuals from eight localities in Chile. Furthermore, by means of signal propagation experiments, we tested the hypothesis that local calls are better transmitted and less degraded than foreign calls (i.e. acoustic adaptation hypothesis). Overall, the advertisement calls varied greatly along the distribution of P. thaul in Chile, and it was possible to discriminate localities grouped into northern, central and southern stocks. Propagation distance affected signal amplitude and spectral degradation in all localities, but temporal degradation was only affected by propagation distance in one out of seven localities. Call origin affected signal amplitude in five out of seven localities and affected spectral and temporal degradation in six out of seven localities. In addition, in northern localities, local calls degraded more than foreign calls, and in southern localities the opposite was observed. The lack of a strict optimal relationship between signal characteristics and environment indicates partial concordance with the acoustic adaptation hypothesis. Inter-population differences in selectivity for call patterns may compensate for such environmental constraints on acoustic communication.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Acoustic ranging allows identifying the distance of a sound source and mediates inter-individual spacing and aggression in territorial species. Birds and mammals are known to use more complex cues than only sound pressure level ({SPL}), which can be influenced by the signaller and signal transmission in non-predictable ways and thus is not reliable by itself. For frogs, only {SPL} is currently known to mediate inter-individual distances, but we hypothesise that the strong territoriality of Dendrobatids could make the use of complex cues for ranging highly beneficial for this family. Therefore, we tested the ranging abilities of territorial males of Allobates femoralis (Dendrobatidae, Aromobatinae) in playback trials, using amplitude-normalized signals that were naturally degraded over distance, and synthetic signals that were masked with different levels of noise. Frogs responded significantly less to signals recorded from larger distances, regardless of {SPL} and signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}), but showed no differential response to natural minimum and maximum {SNRs} across the typical communication range in wild populations. This indicates that frogs used signal amplitude and {SNR} only as ancillary cues when assessing the distance of sound sources and relied instead mainly on more complex cues, such as spectral degradation or reverberation. We suggest that this ability mediates territorial spacing and mate choice in A. femoralis. Good ranging abilities might also play a role in the remarkable orientation performance of this species, probably by enabling the establishment of a mental acoustic map of the habitat. Significance statement: Acoustic ranging allows the distance of vocalizing competitors and mates to be identified. While birds and mammals are known to use complex cues such as temporal degradation, frequency-dependent attenuation and reverberation for ranging, previous research indicated that frogs rely only on signal amplitude (sound pressure level) to assess the distance of other callers. The present study shows for the first time that also poison frogs can make use of more complex cues, an ability which is likely to be highly beneficial in their territorial social organization and probably can also be used for orientation.

	abstract = {The most commonly heard vocalizations of frogs are advertisement calls, which attract gravid females and mediate aggressive interactions between males. Frog vocalizations are energetically costly to produce, and body size often constrains the dominant frequency and intensity of vocalizations; propagation and degradation of these signals are affected by diverse physical and biotic factors. Behaviors and auditory mechanisms that mitigate these problems are discussed. With some exceptions, female preferences based on dominant frequency are intensity-dependent and mediate stabilizing selection within populations. Female preferences based on dynamic, gross-temporal properties typically mediate strong directional selection. The high values of these properties preferred by females increase a male's detectability in dense choruses and are a reliable predictor of his energetic investment in courtship. Female preferences based on fine-temporal properties (e.g. pulse rate) are often in tensity-independent and usually mediate stabilizing selection within populations. The overall attractiveness of a signal depends on variation in more than one of these acoustic properties; their relative importance differs between species. Parsimony analysis supports the idea that auditory biases preceded the evolutionary appearance of call elements that enhance the attractiveness of advertisement calls in one species group of neotropical frogs. A more specific claim that the bias has not been modified by selection after the establishment of the new signal has little empirical support. Indeed, the selective consequences of positive phonotaxis to any ”new” stimulus, whether or not there is a sensory bias, must play a critical role in its establishment and maintenance as a mate-attraction signal and on the further evolution of the female preference. The hypothesis that present-day selective consequences of mate choice have also acted in the past evolution of call structure and preferences is supported by a few examples of reproductive character displacement. However, evolutionary divergence in signals and preferences will have multiple causes, most of which do not involve interactions between species. Phylogenetic analyses and studies of selection and other evolutionary forces in contemporary populations are complementary approaches to gaining insights about the evolution of frog vocalizations and animal communication in general.},

Power analysis is most valuable in the design or planning phases of research efforts. Such prospective (a priori) power analyses can be used to guide research design and to estimate the number of samples necessary to achieve a high probability of detecting biologically significant effects. Retrospective (a posteriori) power analysis has been advocated as a method to increase information about hypothesis tests that were not rejected. However, estimating power for tests of null hypotheses that were not rejected with the effect size observed in the study is incorrect; these power estimates will always be ≤0.50 when bias adjusted and have no relation to true power. Therefore, retrospective power estimates based on the observed effect size for hypothesis tests that were not rejected are misleading; retrospective power estimates are only meaningful when based on effect sizes other than the observed effect size, such as those effect sizes hypothesized to be biologically significant. Retrospective power analysis can be used effectively to estimate the number of samples or effect size that would have been necessary for a completed study to have rejected a specific null hypothesis. Simply presenting confidence intervals can provide additional information about null hypotheses that were not rejected, including information about the size of the true effect and whether or not there is adequate evidence to "accept" a null hypothesis as true. We suggest that (1) statistical power analyses be routinely incorporated into research planning efforts to increase their efficiency, (2) confidence intervals be used in lieu of retrospective power analyses for null hypotheses that were not rejected to assess the likely size of the true effect, (3) minimum biologically significant effect sizes be used for all power analyses, and (4) if retrospective power estimates are to be reported, then the α-level, effect sizes, and sample sizes used in calculations must also be reported.},

	abstract = {Most male frogs produce calls to attract females and repel rivals. The transmission of these calls can be affected by many acoustic and environmental characteristics, which can influence the detection and decoding of the signal by the receiver. Calling-perch height has a strong influence on sound propagation and acoustic spacing with neighboring males, but how frogs optimize their calling behavior in this context is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated if and how frogs can adjust the calling energy in the context of acoustic spacing. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between calling-perch height, nearest-neighbor distance, and sound-pressure level in the brilliant-thighed poison frog Allobates femoralis. We found that frogs flexibly adjust the calling amplitude according to the calling-perch height without affecting the effectiveness signal propagation. Accompanying signal propagation experiments demonstrated that calls produced with lower amplitude from higher perches propagate similar to louder calls from the ground. Our results suggest an adjustment to the hypothesis of a general positive effect of calling-perch height on signal effectiveness, where highly territorial frogs adjust their calling behavior to reduce energy expenditure and optimize acoustic communication with conspecifics.},

	abstract = {Most aquatic mammals have complex social and communication systems. Interestingly, little is known about otters’ vocal communication compared to other aquatic mammals. Here, for the first time, we acoustically describe vocalizations of the neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), a solitary and endangered New World otter species. We recorded vocalizations and behavioral contexts from six captive neotropical otters at Projeto Lontra, Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. Analysis of acoustic parameters were used to classify the vocalizations according to structure and context. We describe six call types with highly tonal as well as chaotic vocalizations with fundamental frequencies ranging from 90 to 2500 Hz. Additionally, we identified sex differences in the usage of calls. Results suggest that the neotropical river otter has a rich vocal repertoire, similar in complexity to other solitary otter species, but less complex than that of the social giant otter. Despite differences in sociality, phylogeny and ecology, L. longicaudis seems to possess vocalizations homologous to those found in other otters (e.g. hah and chirp), suggesting phylogenetic inertia in otter communicative repertoire. Otters thus offer an interesting but neglected group to explore the evolution of communication systems.},

The species was found between 20002500 m.a.s.l., mostly within moss hanging of tree branches in a tropical cloud forest. It can be easily distinguished from other Pristimantis species of the western Andes by the unique black and white patterning in the ventral surface and the flanks, the hourglass-shaped dorsal folds, and the prominent conical tubercles on eyelids, heels, and outer edge of tarsus. A phylogenetic analysis further supports its status of a lineage reciprocally monophyletic to P. satagius and separated by a genetic distance of 0.03; the latter species bear whitish rather than predominantly black ventral coloration. To the best of our knowledge, this species is only known from the 2,500 ha nature reserve Mesenia-Paramillo, despite other research on this area of the country.

The androgen spillover hypothesis counters that enhanced male spatial performance may be a byproduct of higher androgen levels. Animal groups that include species where females are expected to outperform males based on life-­history traits are key for disentangling these hypotheses. We investigated the association between sex differences in reproductive strategies, spatial behavior, and androgen levels in three species of poison frogs. We tracked individuals in natural environments to show that contrasting parental sex roles shape sex differences in space use, where the sex performing parental duties shows wider-­ranging movements. We then translocated frogs from their home areas to test their navigational performance and found that the caring sex outperformed the non-c­ aring sex only in one out of three species. In addition, males across species displayed more explorative behavior than females and androgen levels correlated with explorative behavior and homing accuracy. Overall, we reveal that poison frog reproductive strategies shape movement patterns but not necessarily navigational performance. Together this work suggests that prevailing adaptive hypotheses provide an incomplete explanation of sex differences in spatial abilities.},

Amphibians are especially vulnerable because thermoregulation often trades with appropriate water balance. Although substantial research has evaluated the effect of temperature in amphibian locomotion and physiological limits, there is little information about amphibians living under extreme temperature conditions. Leptodactylus lithonaetes is a frog allegedly specialised to forage and breed on dark granitic outcrops and associated puddles, which reach environmental temperatures well above 40 ˚C. Adults can select thermally favourable microhabitats during the day while tadpoles are constrained to rock puddles and associated temperature fluctuations; we thus established microhabitat temperatures and tested whether the critical thermal maximum ({CTmax}) of L. lithonaetes is higher in tadpoles compared to adults. In addition, we evaluated the effect of water temperature on locomotor performance of tadpoles. Contrary to our expectations, puddle temperatures were comparable and even lower than those temperatures measured in the microhabitats used by adults in the daytime. Nonetheless, the {CTmax} was 42.3 ˚C for tadpoles and 39.7 ˚C for adults. Regarding locomotor performance, maximum speed and maximum distance travelled by tadpoles peaked around 34 ˚C, approximately 1 ˚C below the maximum puddle temperatures registered in the puddles. In conclusion, L. lithonaetes tadpoles have a higher {CTmax} compared to adults, suggesting a longer exposure to extreme temperatures that lead to maintain their physiological performance at high temperatures. We suggest that these conditions are adaptations to face the strong selection forces driven by this granitic habitat.},

For successful reproduction, animals must coordinate internal physiological events with external, climatic, and social environments. There are several types of environmental cue that influence the expression of reproductive behaviors, such as predictable cues, supplementary cues, synchronizing cues, and modifying cues. Understanding the role of hormones in reproductive behavior involves identifying the hormones involved in a particular behavior, determining mechanistically where and how hormones modulate behavioral expression, and determining how environmental cues regulate hormone release and action. This chapter describes that as modern representatives of basal tetrapods, amphibians can provide much insight into conserved endocrine mechanisms of vertebrate behaviors. As a vertebrate class encompassing a diversity of mating systems, amphibians can provide insight into the evolution and ecology of behavioral mechanisms.},

	abstract = {It is now well established that vasotocin ({AVT}) and its mammalian homologue vasopressin influence various social behaviors in vertebrates, but less is known about the mechanisms through which these peptides modulate behavior. In male roughskin newts, Taricha granulosa, {AVT} stimulates a courtship behavior, amplectic clasping. Three general explanations for how {AVT} affects male courtship behavior have been considered: by enhancing a central state of sexual motivation, by affecting sensorimotor integration mechanisms in individual sensory modalities, or by influencing a nonspecific state of attention, arousal, or anxiety. {AVT} administration enhanced appetitive responses to visual and olfactory sexual stimuli, as would be expected if {AVT} affects a state of sexual motivation that affects behavioral responses to sexual stimuli regardless of the sensory modality in which they are processed. However, {AVT} selectively enhanced responses to female olfactory stimuli (sex pheromones), but similarly enhanced responses to female and food-related visual stimuli (worms), thus questioning the utility of such a motivational mechanism, as responses to female stimuli were not selectively enhanced in all sensory modalities. We therefore propose that exogenous {AVT} independently influences olfactory processes associated with orientation/attraction toward a female sex pheromone and visual processes associated with orientation/attraction toward a visual feature common to females and worms. In further experiments {AVT} administration failed to stimulate feeding behavior but did decrease locomotor activity. Thus, {AVT} does not stimulate courtship behavior in this species by enhancing the animals' general state of attention or by decreasing general anxiety, as responses to nonsexual, attractive stimuli were not uniformly enhanced, nor by stimulating general arousal, as activity levels did not increase. Rather, the data support the conclusion that {AVT} affects courtship by influencing specific sensorimotor processes associated with behavioral responses to individual releasing stimuli, which suggests a mechanistic framework for understanding socially motivated behavior is this species.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Arginine vasotocin ({AVT}) is the non-mammalian homolog of arginine vasopressin ({AVP}) and, like vasopressin, serves as an important modulator of social behavior in addition to its peripheral functions related to osmoregulation, reproductive physiology, and stress hormone release. In amphibians and reptiles, the neuroanatomical organization of brain {AVT} cells and fibers broadly resembles that seen in mammals and other taxa. Both parvocellular and magnocellular {AVT}-containing neurons are present in multiple populations located mainly in the basal forebrain from the accumbens–amygdala area to the preoptic area and hypothalamus, from which originate widespread fiber connections spanning the brain with a particularly heavy innervation of areas associated with social behavior and decision-making. As for mammalian {AVP}, {AVT} is present in greater amounts in males in many brain areas, and its presence varies seasonally, with hormonal state, and in males with differing social status. {AVT}’s social influence is also conserved across herpetological taxa, with significant effects on social signaling and aggression, and, based on the very small number of studies investigating more complex social behaviors in amphibians and reptiles, {AVT} may also modulate parental care and social bonding when it is present in these vertebrates. Within this conserved pattern, however, both {AVT} anatomy and social behavior effects vary significantly across species. Accounting for this diversity represents a challenge to understanding the mechanisms by which {AVT} exerts its behavioral effects, as well are a potential tool for discerning the structure-function relationships underlying {AVT}’s many effects on behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Empirical models utilise any mathematical function(s) that appears to have the characteristics of the experimentally derived assay data. Empirical models require no understanding of the principles of the assay. Mechanistic models make assumptions about the physico-chemical processes involved in the assay procedure.

	abstract = {Background: Network analyses of plant-animal interactions hold valuable biological information. They are often used to quantify the degree of specialization between partners, but usually based on qualitative indices such as 'connectance' or number of links. These measures ignore interaction frequencies or sampling intensity, and strongly depend on network size.
Results: Here we introduce two quantitative indices using interaction frequencies to describe the degree of specialization, based on information theory. The first measure (d') describes the degree of interaction specialization at the species level, while the second measure (H2') characterizes the degree of specialization or partitioning among two parties in the entire network. Both indices are mathematically related and derived from Shannon entropy. The species-level index d' can be used to analyze variation within networks, while H2' as a network-level index is useful for comparisons across different interaction webs. Analyses of two published pollinator networks identified differences and features that have not been detected with previous approaches. For instance, plants and pollinators within a network differed in their average degree of specialization (weighted mean d'), and the correlation between specialization of pollinators and their relative abundance also differed between the webs. Rarefied sampling effort in both networks and null model simulations suggest that H2' is not affected by network size or sampling intensity.
Conclusion: Quantitative analyses reflect properties of interaction networks more appropriately than previous qualitative attempts, and are robust against variation in sampling intensity, network size and symmetry. These measures will improve our understanding of patterns of specialization within and across networks from a broad spectrum of biological interactions.},

In the present study, we used wild túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) to investigate the effects of {AVT} on phonotaxis in males and females—thereby controlling for potential task differences between the sexes. Using a combined within- and between-subjects design, we showed that acoustic choice behavior in female frogs is not influenced by injection per se (vehicle) or by {AVT}. Latency to choice in females, however, tends to decrease after {AVT} injection, supporting the hypothesis that {AVT} promotes female sexual arousal. In contrast, male choice behavior and latencies are negatively impacted by injection (vehicle) but rescued to pre-injection levels if administered with {AVT}. The sexes differed in area restricted searching ({ARS}) following choice—a measure of locomotor perseverance—with females but not males exhibiting {ARS}. {AVT} did not influence {ARS} behavior but {ARS} frequency was positively associated with the attractiveness of the acoustic stimulus. Finally, we showed that a female’s latency behavior is correlated with her partner’s behavior. Collectively we show that {AVT} promotes phonotaxis in both sexes in a dimorphic manner—a result that is consistent with sex differences in the neural vasotocin system.},

              Consolation behavior toward distressed others is common in humans and great apes, yet our ability to explore the biological mechanisms underlying this behavior is limited by its apparent absence in laboratory animals. Here, we provide empirical evidence that a rodent species, the highly social and monogamous prairie vole (
              Microtus ochrogaster
              ), greatly increases partner-directed grooming toward familiar conspecifics (but not strangers) that have experienced an unobserved stressor, providing social buffering. Prairie voles also match the fear response, anxiety-related behaviors, and corticosterone increase of the stressed cagemate, suggesting an empathy mechanism. Exposure to the stressed cagemate increases activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, and oxytocin receptor antagonist infused into this region abolishes the partner-directed response, showing conserved neural mechanisms between prairie vole and human.},

	abstract = {Aggressive competition for resources among juveniles is documented in many species, but the neural mechanisms regulating this behavior in young animals are poorly understood. In poison frogs, increased parental care is associated with decreased water volume of tadpole pools, resource limitation, and aggression. Indeed, the tadpoles of many poison frog species will attack, kill, and cannibalize other tadpoles. We examined the neural basis of conspeciﬁc aggression in Dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) tadpoles by comparing individuals that won aggressive encounters, lost aggressive encounters, or did not engage in a ﬁght. We ﬁrst compared patterns of generalized neural activity using immunohistochemical detection of phosphorylated ribosomes ({pS}6) as a proxy for neural activation associated with behavior. We found increased neural activity in the medial pallium and preoptic area of loser tadpoles, suggesting the amphibian homologs of the mammalian hippocampus and preoptic area may facilitate loser-associated behaviors. Nonapeptides (arginine vasotocin and mesotocin) and dopamine have been linked to aggression in other vertebrates and are located in the preoptic area. We next examined neural activity speciﬁcally in nonapeptide- and tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive cells using double-label immunohistochemistry. We found increased neural activity speciﬁcally in the preoptic area nonapeptide neurons of winners, whereas we found no diﬀerences in activity of dopaminergic cells among behavioral groups. Our ﬁndings suggest the neural correlates of aggression in poison frog tadpoles are similar to neural mechanisms mediating aggression in adults and juveniles of other vertebrate taxa.},

We currently have quite an incomplete understanding of the factors that lead to behavioural traits remaining stable – or becoming decoupled – over an animal’s lifetime. In this study, we investigated the role of metamorphosis in the development of animal personality in a Neotropical poison frog, a species that undergoes drastic morphological and ecological changes during its development. We used lab-reared individuals of the brilliant-thighed poison frog Allobates femoralis to assess if consistent individual differences are already present at the tadpole stage, and if these differences are maintained throughout metamorphosis. We found evidence for two personality traits, exploration and boldness, already present in A. femoralis tadpoles. Despite the drastic changes in morphology, physiology, and habitat in the transition from tadpoles to metamorphs, personality traits persisted throughout metamorphosis, suggesting a physiological and/or genetic basis for the measured behavioural traits. We also found that exploration and boldness related behaviours were correlated with growth speed. Very bold and explorative individuals took fewer days until metamorphosis compared to very shy and non-explorative ones, which is in line with the concept of a Pace-of-Life Syndrome. These findings provide important insights into the proximate mechanisms that generate personality in species with complex life cycles.},

Here, we identified salient environmental and physiological antecedents of infanticide in the mimic poison frog (Ranitomeya imitator), a biparental amphibian. We explored potential environmental cues influencing infant-directed behavior by evaluating changes in the frequency of food provisioning and tadpole mortality after either cross-fostering tadpoles between family units or displacing tadpoles within the terraria of their parents. We found that changes in offspring location reduce care and increase infanticide. Specifically, parents fed their displaced offspring less and, in some instances, tadpole mortality increased. We also investigated whether care and infanticide were related to changes in steroid hormone concentrations in an unfamiliar setting. Infanticide of fertilized eggs and hatchlings in the new territory included cannibalism and was associated with lower testosterone concentrations, but not with changes in corticosterone. Overall, our results support earlier findings that familiarity with offspring location drives parental investment in poison frogs, while indicating an association between low androgen levels and infanticidal behavior in an amphibian.},

Dendrobatid poison frogs bioaccumulate alkaloids from their diet to make themselves toxic or unpalatable to predators. Despite the proposed roles of plasma proteins as mediators of alkaloid trafficking and bioavailability, the responsible proteins have not been identified. We use chemical approaches to show that a {\textasciitilde}50 {kDa} plasma protein is the principal alkaloid-binding molecule in blood of poison frogs. Proteomic and biochemical studies establish this plasma protein to be a liver-derived alkaloid-binding globulin ({ABG}) that is a member of the serine-protease inhibitor (serpin) family. In addition to alkaloid-binding activity, {ABG} sequesters and regulates the bioavailability of ‘free’ plasma alkaloids in vitro. Unexpectedly, {ABG} is not related to saxiphilin, albumin, or other known vitamin carriers, but instead exhibits sequence and structural homology to mammalian hormone carriers and amphibian biliverdin-binding proteins. {ABG} represents a new small molecule binding functionality in serpin proteins, a novel mechanism of plasma alkaloid transport in poison frogs, and more broadly points toward serpins acting as tunable scaffolds for small molecule binding and transport across different organisms.},

	abstract = {Background Amphibians represent an important evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments and they display a large variety of complex behaviors despite a relatively simple brain. However, their brain activity is not as well characterized as that of many other vertebrates, partially due to physiological traits that have made electrophysiology recordings difficult to perform in awake and moving animals. New method We implanted flexible mesh electronic recording units in the cane toad (Rhinella marina) and performed extracellular recordings in the telencephalon of anesthetized toads and partially restrained, awake toads over multiple days. Results We recorded brain activity over five consecutive days in awake toads and over a 15 week period in a toad that was anesthetized during recordings. We were able to perform spike sorting and identified single- and multi-unit activity in all toads. Comparison with existing methods To our knowledge, this is the first report of a modern method to perform electrophysiology in non-paralyzed toads over multiple days, though there are historical references to short term recordings in the past. Conclusions Implementing flexible mesh electronics in amphibian species will allow for advanced studies of the neural basis of amphibian behaviors.},

	abstract = {The behavioral, sensory, and neural bases of vertebrate navigation are primarily described in mammals and birds. However, we know much less about navigational abilities and mechanisms of vertebrates that move on smaller scales, such as amphibians. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted an extensive field study on navigation in the cane toad, Rhinella marina. First, we performed a translocation experiment to describe how invasive toads in Hawaiʻi navigate home following displacements of up to one kilometer. Next, we tested the effect of olfactory and magnetosensory manipulations on homing, as these senses are most commonly associated with amphibian navigation. We found that neither ablation alone prevents homing, suggesting that toad navigation is multimodal. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that the medial pallium, the amphibian homolog to the hippocampus, is involved in homing. By comparing neural activity across homing and non-homing toads, we found evidence supporting the involvement of the medial pallium, lateral pallium, and septum in navigation, suggesting a conservation of neural structures supporting navigation across vertebrates. Our study lays the foundation to understand the behavioral, sensory, and neural bases of navigation in amphibians and to further characterize the evolution of behavior and neural structures in vertebrates.},

We studied whether specialist and generalist species are spatially distributed independently of each other. Repeating the analysis for 100 of the most frequent terrestrial bird species recorded over the 10 000 sampled sites of the French Breeding Bird survey, we found that specialists were more abundant if the rest of the community was specialized, and that the inverse was also true. This pattern was far subtler than just a simple dichotomy: most species actually presented a maximum abundance at a value of community specialization similar to their own level of specialization. Bird communities appear very well defined along a specialist–generalist gradient. We believe this pattern becomes more apparent with habitat degradation. The consequences on both ecological services and community resilience may well be considerable.},

One {DHQ} (3) was identical to a known frog-skin alkaloid, cis-195A (cis-5-methyl-2-propyldecahydroquinoline), while the second {DHQ}, an isomer of 3, designated 195J, was assigned a tentative cis-2-methyl-5-propyldecahydroquinoline structure (2) based on mass and infrared spectra. The third alkaloid proved identical to the frog-skin alkaloid 195C, for which a structure had not been previously proposed. Mass and infrared spectral analysis, including chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry, indicated a 4-methyl-6-propylquinolizidine structure (1) for 195C. The four possible diastereomers were synthesized and the (6Z,10E)-4-methyl-6-propylquinolizidine diastereomer (1b) was identical to the natural alkaloid. Skin extracts of a population of a Madagascan mantelline frog contained, among other alkaloids, minor amounts of the same alkaloid triad 1–3 with 1 again predominating. The common occurrence of alkaloids 1–3 in both ant and frog supports the hypothesis that ants are a likely dietary source for sequestered frog-skin alkaloids and brings to six, the alkaloid classes common to ant and frog.},

Of 774 identified prey items, 74\% were ants, 94\% had lengths of 1-4 mm, and none was larger than 5 mm. The results of laboratory prey choice experiments was less unequivocal. In comparison to aposematic dendrobatids (Dendrobates histrionicus, D. leucomelas, Phyllobates bicolor), Mantella species did show much lower preferences for smaller prey, although mean prey size chosen by a pooled group of all Mantella species was significantly smaller than in a comparison group of anuran species of the genera Rana, Bufo, Mantidactylus, Colostethus, and Heterixalus.

Previous literature suggests that conspicuous, but not cryptic, species require diet specialization in prey high in alkaloids. To test for dietary preferences of poison frog species, we identified, to the lowest possible taxonomic rank, the diets of 21 Epipedobates darwinwallacei (conspicuous) and 22 Hyloxalus awa (cryptic) frogs living in syntopy in the Otongachi Forest in northwestern Ecuador. We then tested for differences in diet assemblage composition, and diet specialization, in these putatively conspicuous and cryptic frogs. Our analyses showed significant differences in the composition of arthropod assemblages consumed by both frog species, which translated into a narrow niche breadth and nine arthropod taxa (out of a total of 18) consumed by both species. Moreover, the index of relative importance, which measures frog’s diet specialization, suggested that E. darwinwallacei, and H. awa prefer specific arthropod taxa, where the former consumes preferentially springtails and mites, while the latter consumes mostly ants and Coleoptera larvae. Thus, contrary to expectations, diet specialization is not a unique characteristic of the species with conspicuous traits when living in syntopy.},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/2246/622},
	abstract = {"Studies in progress reveal at least three novel classes of toxic alkaloids in skin secretions of Neotropical dendrobatid frogs. Batrachotoxins are characterized by a steroidal ring structure; those batrachotoxins having a pyrrole carboxylate substituent are among the most toxic of nonprotein poisons. Pumiliotoxins are less toxic and poorly known, but pumiliotoxins A and B appear to have a bicyclic ring system with differing side chains; pumiliotoxin C is a simple cis-decahydroquinoline. Histrionicotoxins have an unusual spiro-ring system and both 4-carbon and 5-carbon side chains, on the cyclohexane and piperidine rings, respectively. Structures are uncertain for other alkaloids of lower molecular weight, but some appear structurally related to pumiliotoxins and others to histrionicotoxins. Methods of study include thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and quantitative mass spectrometry. Combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry gives reproducible results for small-sample taxonomic comparisons of frogs containing pumiliotoxins, histrionicotoxins, and similar alkaloids. Limitations of molecular data in taxonomic and evolutionary studies are considered. Biochemical and other variation are analyzed in Dendrobates histrionicus, a rain-forest frog of western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. Sexual dimorphism is slight, and geographic variation in body size appears correlated with climate. There are geographic differences in relative tibia length and in escape behavior. Interpopulational differences in color and color pattern are extreme, and intrapopulational variation also may be considerable. Most colorations are thought to be aposematic, but highly variable frogs of one population seem cryptically colored. Dendrobates histrionicus elaborates histrionicotoxins and lower molecular-weight alkaloids; one population sample had trace amounts of a higher molecular-weight compound, tentatively identified as pumiliotoxin B. Southern populations produce large amounts of histrionicotoxins and lesser amounts of lower weight alkaloids, a situation reversed in most northern populations. Individual populations have 8-10 of 19 alkaloids detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Alkaloid similarity comparisons show that most populations share more compounds with near than with distant populations; a geographically intermediate population shares as many or more alkaloids with distant as with neighboring populations. Analysis of geographic variation in skin toxins supports the notion of conspecificity of most histrionicus-like frogs, but different spectra of toxins revealed two additional sibling species. These new species resemble D. histrionicus in morphology (including absence of omosternum), vocalizations, and type of male aggressiveness; and their color patterns, although distinctive, are approached in the variation of histrionicus. Dendrobates lehmanni, new species, lacks histrionicotoxins and produces pumiliotoxins and other alkaloids not detected in histrionicus; it is a black frog with crossbands of vivid orange or orange-red. Dendrobates lehmanni was known for years only from specimens sold in the animal trade, but its habitat is traced to a restricted area of montane forest in the Río Anchicayá drainage of the western Andes, Department of Valle, Colombia. Dendrobates occultator, new species, shows greater biochemical resemblance to histrionicus, but shared alkaloid similarity values are relatively low, and it produces significant amounts of pumiliotoxins and only two kinds of histrionicotoxins (5-7 kinds in populations of histrionicus). Dendrobates occultator is a red-backed frog with yellow lateral spots; it occurs in the Pacific lowlands, in the upper Río Saija drainage, Department of Cauca, Colombia, where it is sympatric with a population of histrionicus. Both lehmanni and occultator may have speciated from geographical isolates of histrionicus; it is suggested that some character divergence might have occurred after the range of occultator was rejoined with the parent species. Dendrobates viridis, new species, is also described, as it occurs sympatrically with the other two new species and evidently has an extensive range in Pacific-side Colombia, along the western flank of the Andes. It is a miniature, uniformly green frog, whose skin secretions include pumiliotoxins. Species of Dendrobates in Central America and northwestern South America seem characterized by either of two kinds of vocalizations, which correlate with calling behavior and type of aggressiveness. Buzz calls are a nearly uniform series of pulses, which are produced too fast for resolution by the human ear but which can be directly visualized on sound spectrograms made with a wide-band filter. Buzz calls are given by D. auratus and D. minutus (and 'Phyllobates' espinosai), species that call relatively infrequently and which seem relatively unaggressive. Chirp calls are trains of harsh, poorly modulated notes, in which pulses are produced too fast for resolution on wide-band sound spectrograms. Chirp calls are given by D. granuliferus, D. histrionicus, D. lehmanni, D. occultator, D. pumilio, and D. speciosus -- all of which are characterized by nearly incessant calling from perches, and by pronounced male aggressiveness related to territorial defense. Geographic variation in normal and aggressive calls suggests that D. pumilio may actually be a composite of two species, but biochemical and other variation have yet to be investigated"--P. 177-178.},

The statistical reliability of each index is shown to be a function of the absolute and relative sample sizes and the relative abundances of the prey species in the environment. A linear index of food selection is proposed which avoids most of the statistical and mathematical inadequacies of these indices. Regardless of the index used, however, inadequate habitat sampling, differential availability of prey to the predator, and differential digestion of prey may be significant sources of error in the interpretation of food selection data.},

	abstract = {In recent years the focus in ecology has shifted from species to a greater emphasis on functional traits. In tandem with this shift, a number of trait databases have been developed covering a range of taxa. Here, we introduce the {GlobalAnts} database. Globally, ants are dominant, diverse and provide a range of ecosystem functions. The database represents a significant tool for ecology in that it (i) contributes to a global archive of ant traits (morphology, ecology and life history) which complements existing ant databases and (ii) promotes a trait-based approach in ant and other insect ecology through a broad set of standardised traits. The {GlobalAnts} database is unique in that it represents the largest online database of functional traits with associated georeferenced assemblage-level data (abundance and/or occupancy) for any animal group with 9056 ant species and morphospecies records for entire local assemblages across 4416 sites. We describe the structure of the database, types of traits included and present a summary of data coverage. The value of the database is demonstrated through an initial examination of trait distributions across subfamilies, continents and biomes. Striking biogeographic differences in ant traits are highlighted which raise intriguing questions as to the mechanisms generating them.},

	abstract = {Regrowing secondary forests dominate tropical regions today, and a mechanistic understanding of their recovery dynamics provides important insights for conservation. In particular, land-use legacy effects on the fauna have rarely been investigated. One of the most ecologically dominant and functionally important animal groups in tropical forests are the ants. Here, we investigated the recovery of ant communities in a forest–agricultural habitat mosaic in the Ecuadorian Chocó region. We used a replicated chronosequence of previously used cacao plantations and pastures with 1–34 years of regeneration time to study the recovery dynamics of species communities and functional diversity across the two land-use legacies. We compared two independent components of responses on these community properties: resistance, which is measured as the proportion of an initial property that remains following the disturbance; and resilience, which is the rate of recovery relative to its loss. We found that compositional and trait structure similarity to old-growth forest communities increased with regeneration age, whereas ant species richness remained always at a high level along the chronosequence. Land-use legacies influenced species composition, with former cacao plantations showing higher resemblance to old-growth forests than former pastures along the chronosequence. While resistance was low for species composition and high for species richness and traits, all community properties had similarly high resilience. In essence, our results show that ant communities of the Chocó recovery rapidly, with former cacao reaching predicted old-growth forest community levels after 21 years and pastures after 29 years. Recovery in this community was faster than reported from other ecosystems and was likely facilitated by the low-intensity farming in agricultural sites and their proximity to old-growth forest remnants. Our study indicates the great recovery potential for this otherwise highly threatened biodiversity hotspot.},

	abstract = {The magnitude of worldwide insect decline is hotly debated, with multiple examples of stable or increasing insect populations. In addition, time series data for tropical insects are scarce, notably in rainforests where insect diversity is poorly known but reaches a peak. Despite social insects (ants, termites, bees and allies) being key organisms in these habitats, long-term monitoring data for these groups are crucially lacking. For many of these insects, the difficulty of locating nests in rainforests could be one reason. In this context, species occurrence in samples is often used as a surrogate for abundance to evaluate species distribution in space/time, but the loss of information is difficult to assess. In a tropical rainforest in Panama, we employed various sampling methods to examine the time series of seven insect assemblages with differing degrees of sociality: termite workers and soldiers, termite alates, bess beetles, litter ant workers, army ant alates, orchid bees, and nocturnal sweat bees. We used five community variables and six models related to occurrence and abundance, to test for significant trends in assemblages over a 13-year period (2009–2021). While assemblages of bess beetles increased, those of termite workers and soldiers, army ant alates, and orchid bees remained relatively stable. Termite alate, litter ant worker, and nocturnal bee assemblages showed signs of decline, demonstrating the need for monitoring distinct assemblages. Significant trends in generalized additive mixed models ({GAMM}) were observed in three out of five assemblages that could be tested. Our study indicates that trends in assemblages may be more informatively reported with abundance than with occurrence. We recommend (1) monitoring multiple insect assemblages as ecological indicators responsible for diverse ecosystem services; and (2) reporting species richness, changes in faunal composition, occurrence, and, when possible, using time-explicit analyses (such as {GAMM} models) for evaluating population trends over time.},

Using a unique global database of 1128 local ant assemblages, we examined whether climate mediates the effects of habitat disturbance on assemblage structure at a global scale. Species richness and evenness were associated positively with temperature, and negatively with disturbance. However, the interaction among temperature, precipitation and disturbance shaped species richness and evenness. The effect was manifested through a failure of species richness to increase substantially with temperature in transformed habitats at low precipitation. At low precipitation levels, evenness increased with temperature in undisturbed sites, peaked at medium temperatures in disturbed sites and remained low in transformed sites. In warmer climates with lower rainfall, the effects of increasing disturbance on species richness and evenness were akin to decreases in temperature of up to 9°C. Anthropogenic disturbance and ongoing climate change may interact in complicated ways to shape the structure of assemblages, with hot, arid environments likely to be at greatest risk.},

	abstract = {Environmental stressors and changes in land use have led to rapid and dramatic species losses. As such, we need effective monitoring programs that alert us not only to biodiversity losses, but also to functional changes in species assemblages and associated ecosystem processes. Ants are important components of terrestrial food webs and a key group in food web interactions and numerous ecosystem processes. Their sensitive and rapid response to environmental changes suggests that they are a suitable indicator group for the monitoring of abiotic, biotic, and functional changes. We tested the suitability of the incidence (i.e. the sum of all species occurrences at 30 baits), species richness, and functional richness of ants as indicators of ecological responses to environmental change, forest degradation, and of the ecosystem process predation on herbivorous arthropods. We sampled data along an elevational gradient (1000–3000m a.s.l.) and across seasons (wetter and drier period) in a montane rainforest in southern Ecuador. The incidence of ants declined with increasing elevation but did not change with forest degradation. Ant incidence was higher during the drier season. Species richness was highly correlated with incidence and showed comparable results. Functional richness also declined with increasing elevation and did not change with forest degradation. However, a null-model comparison revealed that the functional richness pattern did not differ from a pattern expected for ant assemblages with randomly distributed sets of traits across species. Predation on artificial caterpillars decreased along the elevational gradient; the pattern was not driven by elevation itself, but by ant incidence (or interchangeable by ant richness), which positively affected predation. In spite of lower ant incidence (or ant richness), predation was higher during the wetter season and did not change with forest degradation and ant functional richness. We used path analysis to disentangle the causal relationships of the environmental factors temperature (with elevation as a proxy), season, and habitat degradation with the incidence and functional richness of ants, and their consequences for predation. Our results would suggest that the forecasted global warming might support more active and species-rich ant assemblages, which in turn would mediate increased predation on herbivorous arthropods. However, this prediction should be made with reservation, as it assumes that the dispersal of ants keeps pace with the climatic changes as well as a one-dimensional relationship between ants and predation within a food-web that comprises species interactions of much higher complexity. Our results also suggested that degraded forests in our study area might provide suitable habitat for epigaeic, ground-dwelling ant assemblages that do not differ in incidence, species richness, functional richness, composition, or predation on arthropods from assemblages of primary forests. Most importantly, our results suggest that the occurrence and activity of ants are important drivers of ecosystem processes and that changes in the incidence and richness of ants can be used as effective indicators of responses to temperature changes and of predation within mega-diverse forest ecosystems.},

The acquisition of noxious/toxic substances can be either endogenous, in which the substances are produced by the organism, or exogenous, in which the substances are produced by another organism and are sequestered. Evidence indicates that the defensive skin alkaloids of Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) have an exogenous source: a diet of ants and other small alkaloid‐containing arthropods, which we term the diet‐toxicity hypothesis. A critical prediction of the diet‐toxicity hypothesis is that independent origins of dietary specialization will be found to be correlated with independent origins of skin alkaloids. We tested this prediction in an integrated framework using comparative methods with new and published data on feeding ecology and chemical defense for 15 species of dendrobatids in five genera. We found a significant correlation between alkaloid profiles and degree of dietary specialization. This reveals a recurring association of dietary specialization and alkaloid sequestration in dendrobatids, which suggests parallel evolutionary trends in the origins of defensive mechanisms.},

These sequestered compounds are hypothesized to function in chemical defense against predators, although this hypothesis has rarely been experimentally evaluated. We investigated the feeding relationship between the specialist sea hare Styiocheilus longicauda (Quoy et Gaimard 1824) and its food, the filamentous cyanobacterium Micvocoleus lyngbyaceus (Kutz.) Crouan. Stylocheilus are found almost exclusively upon Microcoleus in the {\textasciitilde}.d. In the laboratory, Stylocheilus strongly preferred Microcoleusover seven other diets. Individuals fed Microcoleus increased in mass 508\% in I wk, whereas individuals fed five other diets grew much more slowly or lost mass. On Guam, Stylocheilus concentrates the secondary metabolites malyngamide A and malyngamide B from Microcoleusand converts malyngamide B into its acetate. In a variety of assays, whole extracts of Microcoleus, Stylocheilus, and isolated malyngamides at natural concentrations deterred feeding by natural populations of herbivorous and carnivorous fishes in two different reef habitats. Thus, as with other specialist opisthobranchs, S. iongicauda is adapted to feed on chemically defended foods, and it uses sequestered secondary metabolites for its own antipredator defenses.},

These mechanistic considerations are further integrated into the concept of insect–plant coevolution.

Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the {MODIS} satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

	abstract = {Arthropods in the leaf litter layer of forest soils influence ecosystem processes such as decomposition. Climate-change models predict both increases and decreases in average rainfall. Increased drought may have greater impacts on the litter arthropod community. In addition to affecting survival or behaviour of desiccation-sensitive species, lower rainfall may indirectly lower abundances of consumers that graze drought-stressed fungi, with repercussions for higher trophic levels. We tested the hypothesis that trophic structure will differ between the two rainfall scenarios. In particular, we hypothesized that densities of several broadly defined trophic groupings of arthropods would be lower under reduced rainfall. To test this hypothesis, we used sprinklers to impose two rainfall treatments during three growing seasons in roofed, fenced 14-m2 plots and documented changes in abundance from initial, pre-treatment densities of 39 arthropod taxa. Experimental plots were subjected to either {LOW} (fortnightly) or {HIGH} (weekly) average rainfall based upon climate models and the previous 100 years of regional weekly averages. Unroofed open plots, our reference treatment ({REF}), experienced higher than average rainfall during the experiment. The two rainfall extremes produced clear negative effects of lowered rainfall on major trophic groups. Broad categories of fungivores, detritivores and predators were more abundant in {HIGH} than {LOW} plots by the final year. Springtails (Collembola), which graze fungal hyphae, were 3× more abundant in the {HIGH} rainfall treatment. Taxa of larger-bodied fungivores and detritivores, spiders (Araneae), and non-spider predators were 2× more abundant under {HIGH} rainfall. Densities of mites (Acari), which include fungivores, detritivores and predators, were 1.5× greater in {HIGH} rainfall plots. Abundances and community structure of arthropods were similar in {REF} and experimental plots, showing that effects of rainfall uncovered in the experiment are applicable to nature. This pattern suggests that changes in rainfall will alter bottom-up control processes in a critical detritus-based food web of deciduous forests. Our results, in conjunction with other findings on the impact of desiccation on arthropods and fungal growth, suggest that drier conditions will depress densities of fungal consumers, causing declines in higher trophic levels, with possible impacts on soil processes and the larger forest food web.},

	abstract = {In studies of defensive allomones, appropriate methods of presenting chemicals and measuring their deterrent effects on consumers are essential for understanding the contributions that chemicals make to the survivorship of potential prey. However, unnatural chemical presentations and/or ambiguous bioassay responses occasionally have left open questions on some allelochemical effects. This discussion critiques a toxicity bioassay of Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae), a group whose skins are known to possess a diverse array of bioactive alkaloids. The problematic bioassay entails injecting laboratory mice with the skin extracts of frogs and monitoring the time taken for mice to fall back to sleep to estimate extract toxicity, where longer latencies of sleep onset were claimed to reflect greater toxicity. Dendrobatids do not invasively deliver skin alkaloids to offenders, hence the method of injecting mice with skin extracts does not correspond to the frogs’ natural defense mechanisms. Neither does the injection of frog extracts permit gastrointestinal deactivation or clearance mechanisms that may reduce the bioavailability of toxins. Whether or not increased sleep latencies induced by injected skin extracts reflect toxicity, irritability or other effects, the ultimate protective value for frogs of prolonging the wakefulness of mice (or relevant predators) is unclear. Defensible bioassays entail both modes of chemical delivery consistent with those by which would-be predators normally encounter chemicals and quantified measures of responses by predators that detract from their success.},

Here, we investigated the variation of piperidine alkaloid chemistry of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in a provenance-type experiment. Volatile piperidine alkaloids were analysed from current-year mature needles of 12 geographical origins grown for 35 years at the same site. Results indicate that, despite long-lasting similar growth conditions, origins were still showing different alkaloid composition and concentrations, indicating solid genotype variation. The highest total piperidine alkaloid concentrations were detected in the northernmost origins, and a marked positive correlation between piperidine alkaloid concentrations and latitude was found. Positive correlation with latitude seems to be closely linked to negative correlation with annual temperature sum of origins. Interestingly, the changes in concentrations detected were not related to needle size and dilution effect. Regarding the possible herbivore-defense role of P. abies piperidine alkaloids, the high variation between origins could play a role for preventing the invasion of genotypes from different geographical areas.},

	abstract = {Using the family of poison-dart frogs (Dendrobatidae), this study investigates the hypothesis that a trait should evolve to become more specialized: i.e., that diets should evolve to become narrower. I propose and then test a specific hypothesis that specialist diets evolved from generalist diets in the Dendrobatidae, by explicitly defining "specialist" in the context of the foraging ecology of these frogs and by following guidelines for the comparative method proposed by Harvey and Pagel. Overall, the genera judged to be more basal in the phylogeny (Colostethus, Epipedobates, Phyllobates) had wider and more generalist diets, in contrast to taxa higher in the clade (Dendrobates, Minyobates) which had narrower and more specialist diets. However, some genera (Phyllobates, Minyobates) did not fit neatly into this sequence, exhibiting wider and narrower diets, respectively, than expected based on other traits. I tentatively conclude that a narrow diet specializing on ants and mites is a derived trait and that a generalist or opportunistic diet is an ancestral trait in the Dendrobatidae. Moreover, suites of traits related to diet and foraging suggest that foraging ecology may have been a significant force driving radiation of the family at the generic level.},

In addition to ants, beetles, and millipedes, we found that adults of two species of oribatid mites belonging to the cohort Brachypylina, trophically a lower level of animal than ants and beetles, contain dendrobatid alkaloids. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry ({GC}/{MS}) of hexane extracts of adult Scheloribates azumaensis (Oribatida: Acari) revealed the presence of not only pumiliotoxin 251D (8-hydroxy-8-methyl-6-(2′-methylhexylidene)-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane), but also precoccinelline 193C and another coccinelline-type alkaloid. From the corresponding extracts of an unidentified Scheloribates sp., pumiliotoxin 237A (8-hydroxy-8-methyl-6-(2′-methylpentylidene)-1-azabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane) was detected as a minor component, and identified by synthesis. The presence of related alkaloids, namely deoxypumiliotoxin 193H, a 6,8-diethyl-5-propenylindolizidine, and tentatively, a 1-ethyl-4-pentenynylquinolizidine, were indicated by the {GC}/{MS} fragmentation patterns, along with at least another six unidentified alkaloid components. Thus, one possible origin of pumiliotoxins, coccinellid alkaloids, and certain izidines found in poison frogs may be mites of the genus Scheloribates and perhaps related genera in the suborder Oribatida.},

It is widely accepted that avoidance learning by naive predators is fundamental in generating selection for aposematism 2, 3 and mimicry 4, 5 (where species share the same aposematic coloration), and consequently this cognitive process underpins current evolutionary theory 5, 6. However, this is an oversimplistic view of predator cognition and decision making. We show that predators that have learned to avoid chemically defended prey continue to attack defended individuals at levels determined by their current toxin burden. European starlings learned to discriminate between sequentially presented defended and undefended mealworms with different color signals. Once birds had learned to avoid the defended prey at a stable asymptotic level, we experimentally increased their toxin burdens, which reduced the number of defended prey that they ingested in the subsequent trial. This was due to the birds making strategic decisions to ingest defended prey on the basis of their visual signals. Birds are clearly able to learn about the nutritional benefits and defensive costs of eating defended prey, and they regulate their intake according to their current physiological state. This raises new perspectives on the evolution of aposematism, mimicry, and defense chemistry.},

Indeed, a practical obstacle to experimentally disentangling the functional roles of these factors is the host specificity of insect herbivores, particularly toxic plant specialists. In this study, we employ a toxic plant generalist to uniquely disentangle these alternative explanations. We experimentally demonstrate that the value of enemy‐reduced space supersedes that of food quality in determining the diet and host preference of the polyphagous woolly bear caterpillar Grammia geneura (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). Caterpillars sacrificed superior growth efficiency in choosing a mixed diet that included toxic host plants and provided resistance against parasitoids. The resistance of individual caterpillars was associated with the relative amount of defensive plants eaten as well as with the sequestration of pyrrolizidine alkaloids from one such plant (Senecio longilobus).},

We analyze here the interaction between leaf-litter ant species richness, the local communities' morphological structure and fundamental niche within the context of a northeast-southeast latitudinal gradient in one of the world's most species-rich ecosystems, the Atlantic Forest, representing 2,700 km of tropical rainforest along almost 20o of latitude in eastern Brazil. Our results are consistent with an ecosystem-wide pattern in communities' structure, with relatively high species turnover but functionally analogous leaf-litter ant communities' organization. Our results suggest directional shifts in the morphological space along the environmental gradient from overdispersed to aggregated (from North to South), suggesting that primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity (altitude, temperature and precipitation in the case) determine the distribution of traits and regulate the assembly rules, shaping local leaf-litter ant communities. Contrary to the expected and most common pattern along latitudinal gradients, the Atlantic Forest leaf litter ant communities show an inverse pattern in richness, that is, richer communities in higher than in lower latitudes. The morphological specialization of communities showed more morphologically distinct communities at low latitudes and species redundancy at high latitudes. We claim that an inverse latitudinal gradient in primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity across the Atlantic forest may affect morphological diversity and species richness, enhancing species coexistence mechanisms, and producing thus the observed patterns. We suggest that a functional framework based on flexible enough traits should be pursued to allow comparisons at local, regional and global levels.},

Although originally recognized in temperate oribatid species, alkaloids have also been detected in related lineages of tropical oribatids. Many of these alkaloids are also present in a worldwide radiation of poison frogs, which are known to sequester these defensive chemicals from dietary arthropods, including oribatid mites. To date, most alkaloid records involve members of the superfamily Oripodoidea (Brachypylina), although few species have been examined and sampling of other taxonomic groups has been highly limited. Herein, we examined adults of more than 60 species of Nearctic oribatid mites, representing 46 genera and 33 families, for the presence of alkaloids. {GC}–{MS} analyses of whole body extracts led to the detection of 15 alkaloids, but collectively they occur only in members of the genera Scheloribates (Scheloribatidae) and Protokalumma (Parakalummidae). Most of these alkaloids have also been detected previously in the skin of poison frogs. All examined members of the oripodoid families Haplozetidae and Oribatulidae were alkaloid-free, and no mites outside the Oripodoidea contained alkaloids. Including previous studies, all sampled species of the cosmopolitan oripodoid families Scheloribatidae and Parakalummidae, and the related, mostly tropical families Mochlozetidae and Drymobatidae contain alkaloids. Our findings are consistent with a generalization that alkaloid presence is widespread, but not universal in Oripodoidea. Alkaloid presence in tropical, but not temperate members of some non-oripodoid taxa (in particular Galumnidae) deserves further study.},

Oribatid mites recently have been proposed as a major dietary source of poison frog alkaloids. Here, we report on alkaloids common to an oribatid mite and poison frogs. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of methanol extracts of adult Scheloribates laevigatus (Oribatida: Scheloribatidae) revealed nine alkaloids. Five of these have been detected previously in the skin glands of poison frogs: two isomers of the pumiliotoxin 291G, two isomers of the 5,6,8-trisubstituted indolizidine 209C, and the 5,6,8-trisubstituted indolizidine 195G. The other four alkaloids, a pumiliotoxin, a tricyclic (coccinelline-like), and two isomers of an izidine, were not previously known, but are similar in structure to alkaloids found in poison frogs. Alkaloids were not detected in immature S. laevigatus, suggesting that they are adult-specific and possibly the result of mite biosynthesis. Although most of the alkaloids detected in S. laevigatus are common to poison frogs, the geographic distributions of these organisms are not sympatric. The findings of this study indicate that oribatid mites, and in particular, members of the genus Scheloribates, represent a relatively unexplored arthropod repository for alkaloids and a significant dietary source of alkaloids in poison frogs.},

	abstract = {A remarkable diversity of bioactive lipophilic alkaloids is present in the skin of poison frogs and toads worldwide. Originally discovered in neotropical dendrobatid frogs, these alkaloids are now known from mantellid frogs of Madagascar, certain myobatrachid frogs of Australia, and certain bufonid toads of South America. Presumably serving as a passive chemical defense, these alkaloids appear to be sequestered from a variety of alkaloid-containing arthropods. The pumiliotoxins represent a major, widespread, group of alkaloids that are found in virtually all anurans that are chemically defended by the presence of lipophilic alkaloids. Identifying an arthropod source for these alkaloids has been a considerable challenge for chemical ecologists. However, an extensive collection of neotropical forest arthropods has now revealed a putative arthropod source of the pumiliotoxins. Here we report on the presence of pumiliotoxins in formicine ants of the genera Brachymyrmex and Paratrechina, as well as the presence of these ants in the stomach contents of the microsympatric pumiliotoxin-containing dendrobatid frog, Dendrobates pumilio. These pumiliotoxins are major alkaloids in D. pumilio, and Brachymyrmex and Paratrechina ants now represent the only known dietary sources of these toxic alkaloids. These findings further support the significance of ant-specialization and alkaloid sequestration in the evolution of bright warning coloration in poison frogs and toads.},

	abstract = {Poison frogs contain an alkaloid-based chemical defense that is sequestered directly from a diet of alkaloid-containing arthropods. Geographic and temporal variation in alkaloid defense is common in poison frogs and is generally attributed to differences in the availability of alkaloid-containing arthropods. Variable chemical defense in poison frogs may have important consequences for predator−prey interactions, requiring a full understanding of the factors involved in explaining such variation. In the present study, we examine alkaloid variation in the dendrobatid poison frog Oophaga pumilio between males and females on Cayo Nancy (Isla Solarte), located in the Bocas del Toro archipelago of Panama. On average, females contained a significantly larger number and quantity of alkaloids when compared to males. Alkaloid composition varied significantly between males and females, illustrating that chemical defense in this population of O. pumilio is sex-dependent. The variation in alkaloids between sexes is attributed to differences in feeding and behavior between males and females. The majority of alkaloids present in the skin of O. pumilio appear to be of oribatid mite origin, supporting the importance of these dietary arthropods in the chemical defense of poison frogs.},

The highly toxic pumiliotoxins and allopumiliotoxins, along with 5,8-disubstitiuted and 5,6,8-trisubstituted indolizidines, all of which are proposed to be of dietary mite origin, were common constituents in most extracts. One decahydroquinoline ({DHQ}), previously shown be of ant origin, occurred in many extracts often as a major alkaloid, while other {DHQs} occurred rather infrequently. Histrionicotoxins, thought to be of ant origin, did not appear to possess a specific pattern of occurrence among the populations, but when present, were usually found as major components. Certain 3,5-disubstituted pyrrolizidines and indolizidines, known to be of ant origin, did occur in extracts, but infrequently. Alkaloid composition differed with regard to geographic location of frog populations, and for populations that were sampled two or more times during the 30-year period significant changes in alkaloid profiles sometimes occurred. The results of this study indicate that chemical defense in a dendrobatid poison frog is dependent on geographic location and habitat type, which presumably controls the abundance and nature of alkaloid-containing arthropods.},

Toxic and unpalatable substances are often employed by organisms to avoid predators, parasites, and infections. Among anurans, poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae are a well-studied example of a system involving acquired antipredator defenses. In this group, the sequestration of toxic and unpalatable substances has evolved multiple times, exemplifying its selective advantage. However, the poison frog phenotype is complex, involving chemical sequestration, accumulation, and autoresistance. Here, we present a summary of the ecological and evolutionary contexts underlying the origin and maintenance of chemical defenses across Dendrobatidae. Then, we review aspects of the pharmacokinetics of acquiring defensive substances in these amphibians. Finally, we consider some approaches to uncover the basis of toxin autoresistance and future prospects for research in these areas.},

	abstract = {Aposematism is the association, in a prey organism, of the presence of a warning signal with unprofitability to predators. The origin of aposematism is puzzling, because of its predicted low probability of establishment in a population due to the prey's increased conspicuousness. Aposematism is a widespread trait in invertebrate taxa, but, in vertebrates, it is mostly evident in amphibians, reptiles, and fishes. Poison frogs (Dendrobatidae) are one of the most well known examples of the co-occurrence of warning coloration and toxicity. This monophyletic group of mostly diurnal leaf-litter Neotropical anurans has both toxic/colorful and palatable/cryptic species. Previous studies suggested a single origin of toxicity and warning coloration, dividing the family in two discrete groups of primitively cryptic and more derived aposematic frogs. Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses using mostly aposematic taxa supported this conclusion and proposed a single tandem origin of toxicity and conspicuous warning coloration. By using expanded taxon and character sampling, we reexamined the phylogenetic correlation between the origins of toxicity and warning coloration. At least four or five independent origins of aposematism have occurred within poison frogs; by using simulations, we rejected hypotheses of one, two, or three origins of aposematism (P {\textless} 0.002). We also found that diet specialization is linked with the evolution of aposematism. Specialization on prey, such as ants and termites, may have evolved independently at least two times.},

Here we review 150 years of published literature to assemble the first comprehensive species list of continental Ecuadorian ants (excluding the Galapagos Islands). Our main goal is to serve as a reference to the various research initiatives currently being done in the country. We found 2,124 ant records of 679 ant species from 180 localities reported in 149 articles. We used a subset of this database (i.e. 1,125 records left after removal of duplicates and records with no locality information) to review the Ecuadorian regions, provinces, and national parks covered by the list. For a tropical country, both the number of records per ant species (mean=1.8, {SD}=1.9) and the number of ant species per locality (mean=6.2, {SD}=29.7) are extremely low. Moreover, the ant records in our list are biased towards three provinces (Orellana, 410 ant records and 378 ant spp.; Sucumbios, 212 and 177; Pichincha, 129 and 92), one region (Oriente, 779 records and 487 ant species) and non-protected areas (777 ant records and 510 ant spp.). Endemic ants are poorly covered by the Ecuadorian system of protected areas. This study highlights the gaps and opportunities in ant research for the country.},

The abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods was compared among large numbers of samples obtained using pitfall trapping, Berlese and Winkler extraction methods. Highest abundance and frequency of most of the represented taxa indicated pitfall trapping as the ideal method for sampling of ground-dwelling arthropods. However, with possible bias towards surface-active taxa, pitfall-trapping data is inappropriate for quantitative studies, and Berlese extraction is the better alternative. Berlese extraction is the better method for quantitative measurements than the other two methods, whereas pitfall trapping would be appropriate for qualitative measurements. A comparison of the Berlese and Winkler extraction data shows that in a quantitative multigroup approach, Winkler extraction was inferior to Berlese extraction because the total number of arthropods caught was the lowest; and many of the taxa that were caught from an identical sample via Berlese extraction method were not caught. Significantly a greater frequency and higher abundance of arthropods belonging to Orthoptera, Blattaria, and Diptera occurred in pitfall-trapped samples and Psocoptera and Acariformes in Berlese-extracted samples than that were obtained in the other two methods, indicating that both methods are useful, one complementing the other, eliminating a chance for possible under-representation of taxa in quantitative studies.},

Most important prey categories in the diets of the three populations consisted of the same ground-dwelling arthropods. We found evidence for individuals consuming different arrays of prey types in all populations implying that this “generalist” species is actually comprised of individuals eating different sets of the available range of prey. Formicidae, Acari, and Coleoptera were all important alkaloid-containing prey items in the diets of all populations and individuals, although there were differences in their order of importance among populations and individuals use different sets of the entire range of alkaloid-containing preys. Future research should evaluate individual diet variation in other poisonous anurans taxa given that shifts in diet composition might have important implications for understanding the consequences of alternate foraging strategies in the evolution of defensive strategies among species.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of naturally occurring toxins in plant and animal foods represents one of the most significant food safety issues, drawing the attention of both scientists and regulators alike. This unexplored area related to food quality is indeed a big concern for consumers, various regulatory authorities, and food industries. Apart from essential nutrients, several food crops are capable of producing a vast array of nonnutritious secondary metabolic products. These toxins produced as secondary metabolites have the potential to exhibit both beneficial and deleterious effects in both human beings and animals. Nevertheless, there has been huge progress in agricultural practices and food processing technologies, but still the number of nonnutritive substances and naturally derived toxins persist in our diet. 

Handbook of Plant and Animal Toxins in Food: Occurrence, Toxicity, and Prevention, focuses on various selected toxins in foods derived from plants as well as animals. The prominent plant toxins include solanine and chaconine, mushroom toxins, phytates, tannins, oxalates, goitrogens, gossypol, phytohemagglutinins, erucic acid, saponins, cyanogenic glycosides, enzyme inhibitors, {BOAA} (lathyrogens), toxic amino acids and toxic fatty acids. The prominent animal toxins covered in the book include various seafood toxins, shellfish toxins and biogenic amines. 

　
Key Features:


Presents complete information about a plethora of toxins


Provides quick and easy access to data on major plant and animal toxins


Covers distribution of toxins in the plant and animal kingdom


Provides comprehensive information on chemistry, safety and precautions of each toxin


Commencing with a brief introduction of food toxins, this book is designed in such a way that the readers will be introduced to toxicity, safety and occurrence of each toxin selected. It also discusses the in-depth detailed information on food poisoning and its prevention. The book will also shed light on foodborne illness associated with toxins. The primary audience for this work will be food scientists, food toxicologists, university scholars and college students. Furthermore, the book will be of immense help for public health officials, pharmacologists, and food safety officers who are involved with enforcing regulations meant to ensure the safety of a particular food},

Invertebrate species richness and abundance show various elevational patterns. However, the drivers of these differences are not well understood, although microhabitat complexity is potentially important. We studied ground-dwelling ants using pitfall trapping and hand collection on Mt. Wilhelm (Papua New Guinea) from 169 to 3,795 m a. s. l. We tested for the effects of elevation and leaf litter depth (as a measure of microhabitat complexity) on ant abundance, species richness, and composition. We sampled 118 species, with ants present up to 2,331 m a. s. l. Species richness peaked at mid-elevation ( 700 m), but the elevational pattern for abundance varied depending on sampling scale. Leaf litter depth negatively affected abundance once elevation had been accounted for, while elevation and litter depth had an interactive effect on species richness. Species richness was positively related to litter depth at lower elevations, but negatively above 700 m. Species composition varied with elevation and less strongly with leaf litter depth. We speculate that in the lowlands, litter depth rather than temperature limits ant communities. At high elevations, the deeper litter decreases temperature of the litter layer, and temperature becomes limiting. At mid-elevations, temperature is not yet too low, and litter is still relatively deep, hence generating a mid-elevation peak in ant richness. Our results may explain differing richness-elevation patterns of litter arthropods around the world and provide testable predictions for future studies on this topic.},

We verified that the electivity for ants and mites as food items in the diet of the population from Reserva Florestal de Morro Grande is an actual preference. Chiasmocleis leucosticta seems to elect smaller sized genera, such as Solenopsis and Pheidole, and avoid bigger and more aggressive ants, such as Pachycondyla, Camponotus, and Odontomachus. Also, we suggest that for C. leucosticta or even for other Microhylidae there is reason to believe that alkaloids are obtained as part of the diet; related studies on the biochemistry of this family, genus, and species are encouraged.},

Although many aposematic herbivores exploit plant toxins in their own secondary defense, dealing with these harmful compounds might underlay costs. We studied whether the allocation of energy to detoxification and/or sequestration of host plant defense chemicals trades off with warning signal expression. We used a generalist aposematic herbivore Parasemia plantaginis (Arctiidae), whose adults and larvae show extensive phenotypic and genetic variation in coloration. We reared larvae from selection lines for small and large larval warning signals on Plantago lanceolata with either low or high concentration of iridoid glycosides ({IGs}). Larvae disposed of {IGs} effectively; their body {IG} content was low irrespective of their diet. Detoxification was costly as individuals reared on the high {IG} diet produced fewer offspring. The {IG} concentration of the diet did not affect larval coloration (no trade-off) but the wings of females were lighter orange (vs. dark red) when reared on the high {IG} diet. Thus, the difference in plant secondary chemicals did not induce variation in the chemical defense efficacy of aposematic individuals but caused variation in reproductive output and warning signals of females.},

	abstract = {Many chemically-defended/aposematic species rely on diet for sequestering the toxins with which they defend themselves. This dietary acquisition can lead to variable chemical defenses across space, as the community composition of chemical sources is likely to vary across the range of (an aposematic) species. We characterized the alkaloid content of two populations of the Dyeing Poison Frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) in northeastern French Guiana. Additionally, we conducted unpalatability experiments with naive predators, Blue Tits (Cyanistes caeruleus), using whole-skin secretion cocktails to assess how a model predator would respond to the defense of individuals from each population. While there was some overlap between the two D. tinctorius populations in terms of alkaloid content, our analysis revealed that these two populations are markedly distinct in terms of overall alkaloid profiles. Predator responses to skin secretions differed between the populations. We identified 15 candidate alkaloids (including three previously undescribed) in seven classes that are correlated with predator response in one frog population. We describe alkaloid profile differences between populations for D. tinctorius and provide a novel method for assessing unpalatability of skin secretions and identifying which toxins may contribute to the predator response. In one population, our results suggest 15 alkaloids that are implicated in predator aversive response. This method is the first step in identifying the causal link between alkaloids and behavioral responses of predators, and thus makes sense of how varying alkaloid combinations are capable of eliciting consistent behavioral responses, and eventually driving evolutionary change in aposematic characters (or characteristics).},

	abstract = {Ants have outstanding capacity to mediate inter- and intraspecific interactions by producing structurally diverse metabolites from numerous secretory glands. Since Murray Blum’s pioneering studies dating from the 1950s, there has been a growing interest in arthropod toxins as natural products. Over a dozen different alkaloid classes have been reported from approximately 40 ant genera in five subfamilies, with peak diversity within the Myrmicinae tribe Solenopsidini. Most ant alkaloids function as venom, but some derive from other glands with alternative functions. They are used in defense (e.g., alarm, repellants) or offense (e.g., toxins) but also serve as antimicrobials and pheromones. We provide an overview of ant alkaloid diversity and function with an evolutionary perspective. We conclude that more directed integrative research is needed. We suggest that comparative phylogenetics will illuminate compound diversification, while molecular approaches will elucidate genetic origins. Biological context, informed by natural history, remains critical not only for research about focal species, but also to guide applied research.},

	abstract = {The pre-montane forest of the northern Andes is considered one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. Tools for rapidly assessing biodiversity inventories are currently being developed and may aid conservation efforts. Here, we focus on the use of the Ants of the Leaf Litter ({ALL}) protocol as such a tool and describe the composition of an Ecuadorian pre-montane leaf litter ant community. Two 200-m transects (i.e. two complete replications of the protocol) with a total of 40 winkler sacs and 39 pitfall traps were analyzed. In total, we collected 4 875 specimens from 103 species, 37 genera and 9 subfamilies. The abundance-based coverage estimator ({ACE}), an asymptotic estimator of species richness, predicted a total of 109 ant species for the forest ﬂoor, making this ant community one of the most diverse recorded in tropical mid-altitude forests. Subsets of the community sampled by winkler sacs and pitfall traps differed signiﬁcantly. Winkler sacs were more efﬁcient than pitfall traps at capturing individual ants (226\% more) and species (129\% more). Relative to pitfall traps, an analysis of morphology suggested that winkler sacs collected a subset of the ant community that was smaller, less mobile and with smaller eyes (e.g. more subterranean). Finally, we present the ﬁrst published records of the ant species Acanthognathus teledectus Brown \& Kempf 1969, Hypoponera distinguenda (Emery 1890), Prionopelta amabilis Borgmeier 1949, Pachycondyla chyzeri (Forel 1907) and Procryptocerus mayri Forel 1899 for Ecuador.},

Adults of the population living on C. spinosissimum preferred the alkaloid-containing A. alliariae, while adults of the population feeding on A. alliariae showed no preference for either plant. On the other hand, larval growth of both populations is better on C. spinosissimum, without alkaloids. This is especially so in the population that never naturally encounters pyrrolizidine alkaloids; the population living on A. {alIiariae} is apparently better adapted to its host's secondary compounds.

We collected 40 specimens during the rainy season and evaluated the availability of potential prey (terrestrial arthropods) using pitfall traps. The number, frequency, and volume of different prey found in stomachs were measured to determine the relative importance of each prey type in the species’ diet. We assessed the degree of selectivity by comparing the relative abundances of prey types in the stomachs with the availability of potential prey in the environment. We recorded nine potential prey types in the habitat of C. mehelyi, Diptera and Formicidae being the most abundant with 36\% and 18\% of abundance, respectively. Chiasmocleis mehelyi fed on arthropods from four prey categories: Formicidae (91.18\% frequency), Isoptera (11.76\%), Coleoptera (5.88\%), and Acari (2.95\%). The index of food selection indicates that C. mehelyi feeds selectively on Formicidae and consumes other prey types randomly. There was sexual dimorphism in body size, with females being bigger than males. We suggest that dietary habits of C. mehelyi may be related to their active foraging behavior, while the sexual size dimorphism is attributable to sexual selection related to fecundity.},

	abstract = {Poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) are common leaf litter inhabitants of New World tropical rainforests. The name of this group derives from several genera (especially
              Dendrobates, Minyobates,
              and
              Phyllobates
              ) that are aposematically coloured and have toxic skin to varying degrees. Other species in the family, primarily the genus
              Colostethus,
              are cryptically coloured and non‐toxic. Recent studies have revealed that the toxic compounds in the skin, which are lipophilic alkaloids, may have a dietary origin. Diets and associated characteristics, prey size, prey number, and niche breadth, of nine species in five genera, three of which have poisonous species, were examined. Interpretation of these characteristics in light of an independently constructed cladogram revealed the inclusion of a high percentage of Formicidae (ants) in the diets of toxic species. Although alkaloids have been reported in several insect groups, more alkaloids are known from ants than any other group. Species in the genus
              Dendrobates
              , which are poisonous and have many other derived characters, have diets composed of 50–73\% ants, whereas percentages of ants used by non‐toxic species in the genus
              Colostethus
              was 12–16\%. Ants are the major prey category consumed by the five poisonous species considered in this study. In general, frogs separated into two groups. More basal groups with non‐toxic skin and cryptic coloration had diets with low percentages of ants, low numbers of prey per individual, and high niche breadths, indicating inclusion of a broad range of prey categories in their diets. Species with poisonous skin and aposematic coloration had diets with large percentages of ants, large numbers of prey per individual, and low niche breadths, indicating diets with relatively few prey categories. Thus, diet, and the subsequent evolution of uptake systems for alkaloids, may be the primary character that led to the development of toxic skin and permitted aposematism, leading to radiation of poisonous species.},

	abstract = {The ant communities of the leaf litter were studied along an elevational gradient on Mount Kinabalu in primary rain forest systems ranging from dipterocarp hill forest to dwarf forest of the highest altitudes (560, 800, 1130, 1360, 1530, 1740, 1930, 2025, 2300, 2600 m a.s.l.). The litter ant fauna along the gradient included 283 species of 55 genera. The number of ant species in the leaf litter decreased exponentially without evidence of a peak in species richness at mid-elevations. This result is in contrast to many ﬁndings on altitudinal gradients in ants and other animal groups. Most ant species have a very limited altitudinal range leading to high turnover values when comparing communities of different altitudes. Of the ant species, 74\% were even restricted to one site. As evident from this study, altitudinal ranges of species are very narrow. Elevational gradients are therefore extremely species-rich and might serve as a prime example of hot spots of biodiversity. This fact is of great concern when implementing conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Count data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models when observations are correlated in ways that require random effects. However, count data are often zero-inﬂated, containing more zeros than would be expected from the typical error distributions. We present a new package, {glmmTMB}, and compare it to other R packages that ﬁt zero-inﬂated mixed models. The {glmmTMB} package ﬁts many types of {GLMMs} and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here we focus on count responses. {glmmTMB} is faster than {glmmADMB}, {MCMCglmm}, and brms, and more ﬂexible than {INLA} and mgcv for zero-inﬂated modeling. One unique feature of {glmmTMB} (among packages that ﬁt zero-inﬂated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean. Overall, its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, ﬂexibility, and its interface’s similarity to lme4.},

Whereas the venoms of workers of S. invicta and S. richteri contain piperidines with Cla or C15 side chains, the queens of these species produce venoms in which these compounds are essentially lacking. A comparison of the ratio of cis-z-methyl-6-n-undecylpiperidine to trans-z-methyl-6-n-undecylpiperidine in all of these venoms, together with the qualitative differences of other alkaloidal components, particularly in workers of S. richteri and S. invicta, has led to the proposal that the venoms of S. xyloni and S. geminata are similar to the ancestral type, whereas those of S. richteri and S. invicta are more highly evolved.},

Seasonal rainfall affects tropical forest dynamics and behavior of species that are part of these ecosystems. The positive correlation between amphibian activity patterns and rainfall has been demonstrated repeatedly. Members of Dendrobatidae, a clade of Neotropical dart­poison frogs, are well known for their habitat use and behavior during the rainy season, but their behavior during the dry season has received little attention. We studied habitat use and diet of the dendrobatid frog Dendrobates tinctorius in French Guiana during the rainy and dry seasons. Unlike many other dendrobatid frogs, D. tinctorius does not maintain territories for the entire rainy season. Both sexes colonize recently formed canopy­gaps and stay in these forest patches for only a few weeks. The frogs in these patches consume a great diversity of prey, consisting of ants, beetles, wasps, insect larvae, and mites. During the dry season, frogs move to retreat sites in mature forest, such as palm bracts and tree holes. The frogs are less active and consume fewer prey items in the dry season, and they consume fewer wasps and insect larvae, but more termites. Ants are the most common prey items during both the wet and dry seasons. We discuss the effects of shifts in seasonal habitat use on the territorial behavior of dendrobatid frogs.},

              Cardenolides are remarkable steroidal toxins that have become model systems, critical in the development of theories for chemical ecology and coevolution. Because cardenolides inhibit the ubiquitous and essential animal enzyme Na

              ‐{ATPase}, most insects that feed on cardenolide‐containing plants are highly specialized. With a huge diversity of chemical forms, these secondary metabolites are sporadically distributed across 12 botanical families, but dominate the Apocynaceae where they are found in {\textgreater} 30 genera. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated patterns in the distribution of cardenolides among plant organs, including all tissue types, and across broad geographic gradients within and across species. Cardenolide production has a genetic basis and is subject to natural selection by herbivores. In addition, there is strong evidence for phenotypic plasticity, with the biotic and abiotic environment predictably impacting cardenolide production. Mounting evidence indicates a high degree of specificity in herbivore‐induced cardenolides in
              Asclepias.
              While herbivores of cardenolide‐containing plants often sequester the toxins, are aposematic, and possess several physiological adaptations (including target site insensitivity), there is strong evidence that these specialists are nonetheless negatively impacted by cardenolides. While reviewing both the mechanisms and evolutionary ecology of cardenolide‐mediated interactions, we advance novel hypotheses and suggest directions for future work.

Certain alkaloid-containing ants have been considered the primary dietary source, but dietary sources for the majority of alkaloids remain unknown. Herein we report the presence of ≈80 alkaloids from extracts of oribatid mites collected throughout Costa Rica and Panama, which represent 11 of the ≈24 structural classes of alkaloids known in poison frogs. Forty-one of these alkaloids also occur in the dendrobatid poison frog,
              Oophaga pumilio
              , which co-occurs with the collected mites. These shared alkaloids include twenty-five 5,8-disubstituted or 5,6,8-trisubstituted indolizidines; one 1,4-disubstituted quinolizidine; three pumiliotoxins; and one homopumiliotoxin. All but the last of these alkaloid classes occur widely in poison frogs. In addition, nearly 40 alkaloids of unknown structure were detected in mites; none of these alkaloids have been identified in frog extracts. Two of these alkaloids are homopumiliotoxins, five appear to be izidines, four appear to be tricyclics, and six are related in structure to poison frog alkaloids that are currently unclassified as to structure. Mites are common in the diet of
              O. pumilio
              , as well as in the diets of other poison frogs. The results of this study indicate that mites are a significant arthropod repository of a variety of alkaloids and represent a major dietary source of alkaloids in poison frogs.},

	abstract = {Ecological studies of species pairs showed that biotic interactions promote phenotypic change and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. However, it is unclear how phenotypes respond to synergistic interactions with multiple taxa. We investigate whether interactions with multiple prey species explain spatially structured variation in the skin toxins of the neotropical poison frog Oophaga pumilio. Specifically, we assess how dissimilarity (i.e., beta diversity) of alkaloid-bearing arthropod prey assemblages (68 ant species) and evolutionary divergence between frog populations (from a neutral genetic marker) contribute to frog poison dissimilarity (toxin profiles composed of 230 different lipophilic alkaloids sampled from 934 frogs at 46 sites). We find that models that incorporate spatial turnover in the composition of ant assemblages explain part of the frog alkaloid variation, and we infer unique alkaloid combinations across the range of O. pumilio. Moreover, we find that alkaloid variation increases weakly with the evolutionary divergence between frog populations. Our results pose two hypotheses: First, the distribution of only a few prey species may explain most of the geographic variation in poison frog alkaloids; second, different codistributed prey species may be redundant alkaloid sources. The analytical framework proposed here can be extended to other multitrophic systems, coevolutionary mosaics, microbial assemblages, and ecosystem services.},

We explored the hypothesis that differences in feeding behavior and prey choice reﬂect these species’ status as co-mimics in a Batesian system because toxicity in anurans is strongly related to diet. We obtained stomach contents by applying the stomach-ﬂushing technique and data on prey availability through pitfall traps arranged along both sides of the trail where the sympatric species occur. We found that the toxic A. pulchripecta actively selects ants and mites as prey, while the nontoxic A. femoralis feeds opportunistically on beetles, ants, and other sedentary prey such as larval insects and adult spiders. Based on dissimilarity, diversity, electivity, and evenness analysis we concluded that the two frog species exhibited a signiﬁcant difference in prey composition.

Variation in population-level alkaloid proﬁles among species has been documented, and more than 800 different alkaloids have been identiﬁed. In the present study, we examine individual alkaloid variation in the dendrobatid poison frog Dendrobates pumilio among seven populations and between two seasons on Isla Bastimentos, located in the Bocas del Toro archipelago of Panama. Alkaloid proﬁles vary among populations and between seasons, illustrating that chemical defense in this species can vary on a small spatial and temporal scale. Alkaloid variation among populations is marginally correlated with geographic distance, and close populations have proﬁles more similar to each other than to distant populations. Individuals within populations also vary in alkaloid proﬁles. Differences are attributed to both spatial and temporal variations in the availability of alkaloid-containing arthropods. Many of the alkaloids present in the skin of D. pumilio appear likely to be of ant origin, supporting the importance of myrmecophagy in chemical defense among poison frogs. However, a variety of frog skin alkaloids was recently detected in mites, suggesting that mites may also play an important role in chemical defense.},

Here, we tested the generality of that finding by studying the alkaloid composition and palatability of geographically separated blue and orange morphs of the splash-backed poison frog, Adelphobates galactonotus. We identified and quantified the alkaloid composition of each individual frog using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and evaluated the palatability of individual secretions to arthropods conducting feeding trials with Drosophila melanogaster. Despite their conspicuous differences in color and separation on opposite sides of a large aquatic barrier, the two morphs did not differ in alkaloid composition or palatability. This result shows that both color morphs are equally chemically protected and suggests that the color variation is not driven by predator selection.},

Australian frogs in the genus Pseudophryne (Myobatrachidae) represent an understudied lineage of poison frogs, with a unique ability to both sequester dietary alkaloids and synthesize pseudophrynamine alkaloids. Herein, we describe the alkaloid profiles and diet of six species of Pseudophryne (P. guentheri [Boulenger, 1882], P. occidentalis [Parker, 1940], P. semimarmorata [Lucas, 1892], P. dendyi [Lucas 1892], P. bibronii [Günther, 1859], and P. coriacea [Keferstein, 1868]) to gain a better understanding of how alkaloid defenses and diet are related within and among species. We characterized and quantified alkaloids using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry ({GC}-{MS}), and assessed diet by way of dissection and examination of stomach contents using light microscopy. We found that alkaloid profiles varied significantly among species, with pumiliotoxins (dietary-derived) and pseudophrynamines (biosynthesized) being the most abundant alkaloids. Pseudophryne bibronii and P. dendyi contained mostly dietary-derived alkaloids, whereas P. coriacea, P. guentheri, P. semimarmorata, and P. occidentalis possessed mostly biosynthesized alkaloids. The stomachs of all the studied species were largely empty, containing mostly soil and few partially digested insects. Our data suggest that frogs eat minimally during the breeding season. Therefore, a decrease in dietary alkaloids may be compensated by the biosynthesized pseudophrynamines, which could allow Australian poison frogs to remain defended from predators during this vulnerable time period.},

Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended. As a result, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete. Here we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.},

Chemically defended organisms may need to balance chemical defense acquisition and nutritional quality of prey items. However, these dietary preferences and potential tradeoffs are rarely considered in the framework of diet-derived defenses. Poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) acquire defensive alkaloids from their arthropod diet of ants and mites, although their dietary preferences have never been investigated. We conducted prey preference assays with the Dyeing Poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) to test the hypothesis that alkaloid load and prey traits influence frog dietary preferences. We tested size preferences (big versus small) within each of four prey groups (ants, beetles, flies, and fly larvae) and found that frogs preferred interacting with smaller prey items of the fly and beetle groups. Frog taxonomic prey preferences were also tested as we experimentally increased their chemical defense load by feeding frogs decahydroquinoline, an alkaloid compound similar to those naturally found in their diet. Contrary to our expectations, overall preferences did not change during alkaloid consumption, as frogs across groups preferred fly larvae over other prey. Finally, we assessed the protein and lipid content of prey items and found that small ants have the highest lipid content while large fly larvae have the highest protein content. Our results suggest that consideration of toxicity and prey nutritional value are important factors in understanding the evolution of acquired chemical defenses and niche partitioning.},

	abstract = {Predator–prey relationships are a central component of community dynamics. Classic approaches have tried to understand and predict these relationships in terms of consumptive interactions between predator and prey species, but characterizing the interaction this way is insufficient to predict the complexity and context dependency inherent in predator–prey relationships. Recent approaches have begun to explore predator–prey relationships in terms of an evolutionary-ecological game in which predator and prey adapt to each other through reciprocal interactions involving context-dependent expression of functional traits that influence their biomechanics. Functional traits are defined as any morphological, behavioral, or physiological trait of an organism associated with a biotic interaction. Such traits include predator and prey body size, predator and prey personality, predator hunting mode, prey mobility, prey anti-predator behavior, and prey physiological stress. Here, I discuss recent advances in this functional trait approach. Evidence shows that the nature and strength of many interactions are dependent upon the relative magnitude of predator and prey functional traits. Moreover, trait responses can be triggered by non-consumptive predator–prey interactions elicited by responses of prey to risk of predation. These interactions in turn can have dynamic feedbacks that can change the context of the predator–prey interaction, causing predator and prey to adapt their traits—through phenotypically plastic or rapid evolutionary responses—and the nature of their interaction. Research shows that examining predator–prey interactions through the lens of an adaptive evolutionary-ecological game offers a foundation to explain variety in the nature and strength of predator–prey interactions observed in different ecological contexts.},

Over the past 40 years, more than 800 alkaloids, which are generally organized into 28 structural classes, have been identified in several lineages of poison frogs worldwide. Originally, the presence of alkaloids in frogs was thought to be the result of biosynthesis, however research led largely by John W. Daly resulted in the discovery that most of these alkaloids are sequestered unchanged from dietary arthropods. In the present paper, we review the most significant findings and studies that led to the proposal of the ‘dietary hypothesis’.},

This study examines interactions between the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, and other above-ground foraging ants in two habitats in northeastern Argentina. A combination of pitfall traps and baits was used to characterize the ant communities, their dominance relationships, and to evaluate the effect of phorid flies on the interactions. Twenty-eight ant species coexisted with S. invicta in a gallery forest gap, whereas only ten coexisted with S. invicta in a xerophytic forest grassland. S. invicta was the most numerically dominant species in the richest and complex habitat (gallery forest); however it performed better as discoverer and dominator in the simpler habitat. S. invicta was active during day and night. In spite of its poor capacity to discover resources, S. invicta showed the highest ecological dominance and the second-best behavioral dominance after Camponotus blandus. S. invicta won 78\% of the interactions with other ants, mostly against its most frequent competitor, Pheidole cf. obscurithorax, dominating baits via mass recruitment and chemical aggression. P. cf. obscurithorax was the best food discoverer. S. invicta won 80\% of the scarce interactions with Linepithema humile.Crematogaster quadriformis was one of the fastest foragers and the only ant that won an equal number of contests against S. invicta. The low presence of phorid flies affected the foraging rate of S. invicta, but not the outcome of interspecific interactions. This study revealed that the red imported fire ant ecologically dominated other terrestrial ants in its native range; however, other species were able to be numerically dominant or co-dominant in its presence.},

Although many food items are available in the environment for a frog, it can choose to feed on one item instead of another, depending on several aspects of the prey, such as size, availability, abundance, mobility, and palatability. In this study we compared the frequency of each food item we observed in stomachs of the frog Chiasmocleis leucosticta with the availability of leaf litter arthropods we collected at the same place and time that of the frogs through Ivlev’s electivity index. We veriﬁed that the electivity for ants and mites as food items in the diet of the population from Reserva Florestal de Morro Grande is an actual preference. Chiasmocleis leucosticta seems to elect smaller sized genera, such as Solenopsis and Pheidole, and avoid bigger and more aggressive ants, such as Pachycondyla, Camponotus, and Odontomachus. Also, we suggest that for C. leucosticta or even for other Microhylidae there is reason to believe that alkaloids are obtained as part of the diet; related studies on the biochemistry of this family, genus, and species are encouraged.},

	abstract = {Poison frogs bioaccumulate alkaloids for chemical defense from their arthropod diet. Although many alkaloids are accumulated without modification, some poison frog species can metabolize pumiliotoxin ({PTX} 251D) into the more potent allopumiliotoxin ({aPTX} 267A). Despite extensive research characterizing the chemical arsenal of poison frogs, the physiological mechanisms involved in the sequestration and metabolism of individual alkaloids remain unclear. We first performed a feeding experiment with the Dyeing poison frog (Dendrobates tinctorius) to ask if this species can metabolize {PTX} 251D into {aPTX} 267A and what gene expression changes are associated with {PTX} 251D exposure in the intestines, liver, and skin. We found that D. tinctorius can metabolize {PTX} 251D into {aPTX} 267A, and that {PTX} 251D exposure changed the expression level of genes involved in immune system function and small molecule metabolism and transport. To better understand the functional significance of these changes in gene expression, we then conducted a series of high-throughput screens to determine the molecular targets of {PTX} 251D and identify potential proteins responsible for metabolism of {PTX} 251D into {aPTX} 267A. Although screens of {PTX} 251D binding human voltage-gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors were inconclusive, we identified human {CYP}2D6 as a rapid metabolizer of {PTX} 251D in a cytochrome P450 screen. Furthermore, a {CYP}2D6-like gene had increased expression in the intestines of animals fed {PTX}, suggesting this protein may be involved in {PTX} metabolism. These results show that individual alkaloids can modify gene expression across tissues, including genes involved in alkaloid metabolism. More broadly, this work suggests that specific alkaloid classes in wild diets may induce physiological changes for targeted accumulation and metabolism.},

In poison frogs (family Dendrobatidae), the skin microbiome is exposed to alkaloids that the frogs sequester for defense.14–19 These alkaloids are antimicrobial20–22; however, their effect on the frogs’ skin microbiome is unknown. To test this, we characterized microbial communities from ﬁeld-collected dendrobatid frogs. Then, we conducted a laboratory experiment to monitor the effect of the alkaloid decahydroquinoline ({DHQ}) on the microbiome of two frog species with contrasting alkaloid loads in nature. In both datasets, we found that alkaloid-exposed microbiomes were more phylogenetically diverse, with an increase in diversity among rare taxa. To better understand the isolate-speciﬁc response to alkaloids, we cultured microbial isolates from poison frog skin and found that many isolates exhibited enhanced growth or were not impacted by the addition of {DHQ}. To further explore the microbial response to alkaloids, we sequenced the metagenomes from high- and low-alkaloid frogs and observed a greater diversity of genes associated with nitrogen and carbon metabolism in highalkaloid frogs. From these data, we hypothesized that some strains may metabolize the alkaloids. We used stable isotope tracing coupled to {nanoSIMS} (nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry), which supported the idea that some of these isolates are able to metabolize {DHQ}. Together, these data suggest that poison frog alkaloids open new niches for skin-associated microbes with speciﬁc adaptations, such as alkaloid metabolism, that enable survival in this environment.},
